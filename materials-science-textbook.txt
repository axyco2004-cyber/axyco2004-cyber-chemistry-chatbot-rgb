Preface 



In this Eighth Edition we have retained the objectives and approaches for teach¬ 
ing materials science and engineering that were presented in previous editions. The 
first, and primary, objective is to present the basic fundamentals on a level appro¬ 
priate for university/college students who have completed their freshmen calculus, 
chemistry, and physics courses. In order to achieve this goal, we have endeavored 
to use terminology that is familiar to the student who is encountering the discipline 
of materials science and engineering for the first time, and also to define and ex¬ 
plain all unfamiliar terms. 

The second objective is to present the subject matter in a logical order, from 
the simple to the more complex. Each chapter builds on the content of previous 
ones. 

The third objective, or philosophy, that we strive to maintain throughout the 
text is that if a topic or concept is worth treating, then it is worth treating in suffi¬ 
cient detail and to the extent that students have the opportunity to fully understand 
it without having to consult other sources; also, in most cases, some practical rele¬ 
vance is provided. Discussions are intended to be clear and concise and to begin at 
appropriate levels of understanding. 

The fourth objective is to include features in the book that will expedite the 
learning process. These learning aids include: 

• Numerous illustrations, now presented in full color, and photographs to help 
visualize what is being presented; 

• Learning objectives, to focus student attention on what they should be getting 
from each chapter; 

• “Why Study ...” and “Materials of Importance” items that provide relevance 
to topic discussions; 

• “Concept Check” questions that test whether or not a student understands 
the subject matter on a conceptual level; 

• Key terms and descriptions of key equations highlighted in the margins for 
quick reference; 

• End-of-chapter questions and problems designed to progressively develop 
students’ understanding of concepts and facility with skills; 

• Answers to selected problems, so that students can check their work; 

• A glossary, list of symbols, and references to facilitate understanding the 
subject matter. 

The fifth objective is to enhance the teaching and learning process by using the 
newer technologies that are available to most instructors and students of engi¬ 
neering today.

viii * Preface 


Features That Are New to This Edition 

New/Revised Content 

Several important changes have been made with this Eighth Edition. One of the 
most significant is the incorporation of a number of new sections, as well as revisions/ 
amplifications of other sections. New sections/discussions are as follows: 

• Diffusion in semiconductors (Section 5.6). 

• Flash memory (in Section 18.15). 

• “Biodegradable and Biorenewable Polymers/Plastics” Materials of Importance 
piece in Chapter 22. 

Other revisions and additions include the following: 

• Expanded discussion on nanomaterials (Section 1.5). 

• A more comprehensive discussion on the construction of crystallographic 
directions in hexagonal unit cells —also of conversion from the three-index 
scheme to four-index (Section 3.9). 

• Expanded discussion on titanium alloys (Section 11.3). 

• Revised and enlarged treatment of hardness and hardness testing of ceram¬ 
ics (Section 12.11). 

• Updated discussion on the process for making sheet glass (in Section 13.9). 

• Updates on magnetic storage (hard disk drives and magnetic tapes —Section 

20 . 11 ). 

• Minor updates and revisions in Chapter 22 (“Economic, Environmental, 
and Societal Issues in Materials Science and Engineering”), especially on 
recycling. 

• Appendix C (“Costs and Relative Costs for Selected Engineering Materials”) 

has been updated. 

• End-of chapter summaries have been revised to reflect answers/responses to 
the extended lists of learning objectives, to better serve students as a study 
guide. 

• Summary table of important equations at the end of each chapter. 

• Summary list of symbols at the end of each chapter. 

• New chapter-opener photos and layouts, focusing on applications of materials 
science to help engage students and motivate a desire to learn more about 
materials science. 

• Virtually all Homework problems requiring computations have been refreshed. 

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Correlations 

One new feature that has been incorporated throughout this new edition is a track¬ 
ing of relationships among the processing, structure, properties, and performance 
components for four different materials: steel alloys, glass-ceramics, polymer fibers, 
and silicon semiconductors.This concept is outlined in Chapter 1 (Section 1.7), which 
includes the presentation of a “topic timeline.” This timeline notes those locations 
(by section) where discussions involving the processing, structure, properties, and 
performance of each of these four material types are found. 

These discussions are introduced in the “Why Study?” sections of appropriate 
chapters, and, in addition, end-of-chapter summaries with relational diagrams are 
also included. Finally, for each of the four materials a processing/structure/properties/ 


Preface • ix 


performance summary appears at the end of that chapter in which the last item on 
the topic timeline appears. 

Discipline-Specific Modules 

A set of discipline-specific modules appear on the book’s web site (Student Com¬ 
panion Site). These modules treat materials science/engineering topics not covered 
in the print text that are relevant to specific engineering disciplines—mechanical 
and biomaterials. 

All Chapters Now In Print 

Five chapters of the previous edition were in electronic format only (i.e., not in 
print). In this edition, all chapters are in print 

Case Studies 

In prior editions, “Materials Selection and Design Considerations” consisted of a 
series of case studies that were included as Chapter 22. These case studies will 
now appear as a library of case studies on the book’s web site (Student Compan¬ 
ion Site) at www.wiley.com/college/callister. This library includes the following: 

• Materials Selection for a Torsionally Stressed Cylindrical Shaft 

• Automobile Valve Spring 

• Failure of an Automobile Rear Axle 

• Artificial Total Hip Replacement 

• Chemical Protective Clothing 

• Materials for Integrated Circuit Packages 

Student Learning Resources 

(WWW. WILEY. COM/COLLEGE/CALLISTER) 

Also found on the book’s web site (Student Companion Site) are several impor¬ 
tant instructional elements for the student that complement the text; these include 
the following: 

1. VMSE: Virtual Materials Science and Engineering. This is an expanded ver¬ 
sion of the software program that accompanied the previous edition. It consists of 
interactive simulations and animations that enhance the learning of key concepts in 
materials science and engineering, and, in addition, a materials properties/cost data¬ 
base. Students can access VMSE via the registration code included on the inside 
front cover of the textbook. 

Throughout the book, whenever there is some text or a problem that is supple¬ 
mented by VMSE, a small “icon” that denotes the associated module is included in 
one of the margins. These modules and their corresponding icons are as follows:

2. Answers to Concept Check questions. Students can visit the web site to find 
the correct answers to the Concept Check questions. 

3. Extended Learning Objectives— a more extensive list of learning objectives 
than is provided at the beginning of each chapter. These direct the student to study 
the subject material to a greater degree of depth. 

4. Direct access to online self-assessment exercises. This is a Web-based assess¬ 
ment program that contains questions and problems similar to those found in the 
text; these problems/questions are organized and labeled according to textbook sec¬ 
tions. An answer/solution that is entered by the user in response to a question/problem 
is graded immediately, and comments are offered for incorrect responses. The student 
may use this electronic resource to review course material, and to assess his/her 
mastery and understanding of topics covered in the text. 

5. Index of Learning Styles. Upon answering a 44-item questionnaire, a user’s 
learning style preference (i.e., the manner in which information is assimilated and 
processed) is assessed. 


Instructors’ Resources 

The Instructor Companion Site ( www.wiley.com/college/callister ) is available for in¬ 
structors who have adopted this text. Please visit the web site to register for access. 
Resources that are available include the following: 

1. Instructor Solutions Manual. Detailed solutions of all end-of-chapter ques¬ 
tions and problems (in both Word® and Adobe Acrobat® PDF formats). 

2. Photographs, illustrations, and tables that appear in the book. These are in 
both PDF and JPEG formats so that an instructor can print them for handouts or 
prepare transparencies in his/her desired format. 

3. A set of PowerPoint ® lecture slides. These slides, developed by Peter 
M. Anderson (The Ohio State University), and adapted by the text authors, fol¬ 
low the flow of topics in the text, and include materials from the text and from 
other sources. Instructors may use the slides as is or edit them to fit their teach¬ 
ing needs. 

4. A list of classroom demonstrations and laboratory experiments. These 
portray phenomena and/or illustrate principles that are discussed in the book; 
references are also provided that give more detailed accounts of these demon¬ 
strations.

1.1 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 

Materials are probably more deep-seated in our culture than most of us realize. 
Transportation, housing, clothing, communication, recreation, and food production— 
virtually every segment of our everyday lives is influenced to one degree or another 
by materials. Historically, the development and advancement of societies have been 
intimately tied to the members’ ability to produce and manipulate materials to fill 
their needs. In fact, early civilizations have been designated by the level of their 
materials development (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age). 1 

The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number of materials, 
those that occur naturally: stone, wood, clay, skins, and so on. With time they dis¬ 
covered techniques for producing materials that had properties superior to those 
of the natural ones; these new materials included pottery and various metals. Fur¬ 
thermore, it was discovered that the properties of a material could be altered by 
heat treatments and by the addition of other substances. At this point, materials uti¬ 
lization was totally a selection process that involved deciding from a given, rather 
limited set of materials the one best suited for an application by virtue of its char¬ 
acteristics. It was not until relatively recent times that scientists came to understand 
the relationships between the structural elements of materials and their properties. 
This knowledge, acquired over approximately the past 100 years, has empowered 
them to fashion, to a large degree, the characteristics of materials. Thus, tens of thou¬ 
sands of different materials have evolved with rather specialized characteristics that 
meet the needs of our modern and complex society; these include metals, plastics, 
glasses, and fibers. 

The development of many technologies that make our existence so com¬ 
fortable has been intimately associated with the accessibility of suitable materials. 
An advancement in the understanding of a material type is often the fore¬ 
runner to the stepwise progression of a technology. For example, automobiles 
would not have been possible without the availability of inexpensive steel or 
some other comparable substitute. In our contemporary era, sophisticated elec¬ 
tronic devices rely on components that are made from what are called semicon¬ 
ducting materials.

1.2 MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 

Sometimes it is useful to subdivide the discipline of materials science and engi¬ 
neering into materials science and materials engineering subdisciplines. Strictly 
speaking, materials science involves investigating the relationships that exist be¬ 
tween the structures and properties of materials. In contrast, materials engineering 
is, on the basis of these structure-property correlations, designing or engineering 
the structure of a material to produce a predetermined set of properties. 2 From a 
functional perspective, the role of a materials scientist is to develop or synthesize 
new materials, whereas a materials engineer is called upon to create new products 
or systems using existing materials, and/or to develop techniques for processing 
materials. Most graduates in materials programs are trained to be both materials 
scientists and materials engineers. 

Structure is at this point a nebulous term that deserves some explanation. In 
brief, the structure of a material usually relates to the arrangement of its internal 
components. Subatomic structure involves electrons within the individual atoms and 
interactions with their nuclei. On an atomic level, structure encompasses the or¬ 
ganization of atoms or molecules relative to one another. The next larger structural 
realm, which contains large groups of atoms that are normally agglomerated to¬ 
gether, is termed microscopic, meaning that which is subject to direct observation 
using some type of microscope. Finally, structural elements that may be viewed with 
the naked eye are termed macroscopic. 

The notion of property deserves elaboration. While in service use, all materials 
are exposed to external stimuli that evoke some type of response. For example, a 
specimen subjected to forces will experience deformation, or a polished metal surface 
will reflect light. A property is a material trait in terms of the kind and magnitude of 
response to a specific imposed stimulus. Generally, definitions of properties are 
made independent of material shape and size. 

Virtually all important properties of solid materials may be grouped into six 
different categories: mechanical, electrical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and deterio¬ 
rative. For each there is a characteristic type of stimulus capable of provoking dif¬ 
ferent responses. Mechanical properties relate deformation to an applied load or 
force; examples include elastic modulus (stiffness), strength, and toughness. For elec¬ 
trical properties, such as electrical conductivity and dielectric constant, the stimu¬ 
lus is an electric field. The thermal behavior of solids can be represented in terms 
of heat capacity and thermal conductivity. Magnetic properties demonstrate the re¬ 
sponse of a material to the application of a magnetic field. For optical properties, 
the stimulus is electromagnetic or light radiation; index of refraction and reflectiv¬ 
ity are representative optical properties. Finally, deteriorative characteristics relate 
to the chemical reactivity of materials. The chapters that follow discuss properties 
that fall within each of these six classifications. 

In addition to structure and properties, two other important components are 
involved in the science and engineering of materials—namely, processing and per¬ 
formance. With regard to the relationships of these four components, the structure 
of a material will depend on how it is processed. Furthermore, a material’s per¬ 
formance will be a function of its properties. Thus, the interrelationship between 
processing, structure, properties, and performance is as depicted in the schematic 


2 Throughout this text we draw attention to the relationships between material properties 
and structural elements.

illustration shown in Figure 1.1. Throughout this text we draw attention to the 
relationships among these four components in terms of the design, production, and 
utilization of materials. 

We now present an example of these processing-structure-properties-performance 
principles with Figure 1.2, a photograph showing three thin disk specimens placed 
over some printed matter. It is obvious that the optical properties (i.e., the light trans¬ 
mittance) of each of the three materials are different; the one on the left is trans¬ 
parent (i.e., virtually all of the reflected light passes through it), whereas the disks in 
the center and on the right are, respectively, translucent and opaque. All of these spec¬ 
imens are of the same material, aluminum oxide, but the leftmost one is what we call 
a single crystal—that is, has a high degree of perfection—which gives rise to its trans¬ 
parency. The center one is composed of numerous and very small single crystals that 
are all connected; the boundaries between these small crystals scatter a portion of the 
light reflected from the printed page, which makes this material optically translucent. 
Finally, the specimen on the right is composed not only of many small, interconnected 
crystals, but also of a large number of very small pores or void spaces. These pores 
also effectively scatter the reflected light and render this material opaque. 

Thus, the structures of these three specimens are different in terms of crystal 
boundaries and pores, which affect the optical transmittance properties. Further¬ 
more, each material was produced using a different processing technique. And, of 
course, if optical transmittance is an important parameter relative to the ultimate 
in-service application, the performance of each material will be different. 



Figure 1.2 Three thin disk specimens of aluminum oxide that have been placed over a 
printed page in order to demonstrate their differences in light-transmittance characteristics. 
The disk on the left is transparent (i.e., virtually all light that is reflected from the page 
passes through it), whereas the one in the center is translucent (meaning that some of this 
reflected light is transmitted through the disk). The disk on the right is opaque—that is, none 
of the light passes through it. These differences in optical properties are a consequence of 
differences in structure of these materials, which have resulted from the way the materials 
were processed. (Specimen preparation, P. A. Lessing; photography by S. Tanner.)

1.3 WHY STUDY MATERIALS SCIENCE 
AND ENGINEERING? 

Why do we study materials? Many an applied scientist or engineer, whether me¬ 
chanical, civil, chemical, or electrical, will at one time or another be exposed to a 
design problem involving materials. Examples might include a transmission gear, 
the superstructure for a building, an oil refinery component, or an integrated cir¬ 
cuit chip. Of course, materials scientists and engineers are specialists who are to¬ 
tally involved in the investigation and design of materials. 

Many times, a materials problem is one of selecting the right material from the 
thousands that are available. The final decision is normally based on several criteria. 
First of all, the in-service conditions must be characterized, for these will dictate the 
properties required of the material. On only rare occasions does a material possess 
the maximum or ideal combination of properties. Thus, it may be necessary to trade 
one characteristic for another. The classic example involves strength and ductility; 
normally, a material having a high strength will have only a limited ductility. In such 
cases a reasonable compromise between two or more properties may be necessary. 

A second selection consideration is any deterioration of material properties 
that may occur during service operation. For example, significant reductions in me¬ 
chanical strength may result from exposure to elevated temperatures or corrosive 
environments. 

Finally, probably the overriding consideration is that of economics: What will 
the finished product cost? A material may be found that has the ideal set of prop¬ 
erties but is prohibitively expensive. Here again, some compromise is inevitable. 
The cost of a finished piece also includes any expense incurred during fabrication 
to produce the desired shape. 

The more familiar an engineer or scientist is with the various characteristics 
and structure-property relationships, as well as processing techniques of materials, 
the more proficient and confident he or she will be in making judicious materials 
choices based on these criteria. 

1.4 CLASSIFICATION OF MATERIALS 

Solid materials have been conveniently grouped into three basic categories: met¬ 
als, ceramics, and polymers. This scheme is based primarily on chemical makeup 
and atomic structure, and most materials fall into one distinct grouping or another. 
In addition, there are the composites, which are engineered combinations of two 
or more different materials. A brief explanation of these material classifications 
and representative characteristics is offered next. Another category is advanced 
materials—those used in high-technology applications, such as semiconductors, bio¬ 
materials, smart materials, and nanoengineered materials; these are discussed in 
Section 1.5. 

Metals 

Materials in this group are composed of one or more metallic elements (e.g., iron, 
aluminum, copper, titanium, gold, and nickel), and often also nonmetallic elements 
(e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) in relatively small amounts. 3 Atoms in metals and 
their alloys are arranged in a very orderly manner (as discussed in Chapter 3), and 
in comparison to the ceramics and polymers, are relatively dense (Figure 1.3). With 

3 The term metal alloy refers to a metallic substance that is composed of two or more 
elements.

regard to mechanical characteristics, these materials are relatively stiff (Figure 1.4) 
and strong (Figure 1.5), yet are ductile (i.e., capable of large amounts of deformation 
without fracture), and are resistant to fracture (Figure 1.6), which accounts for their 
widespread use in structural applications. Metallic materials have large numbers of 
nonlocalized electrons; that is, these electrons are not bound to particular atoms. Many 
properties of metals are directly attributable to these electrons. For example, metals 
are extremely good conductors of electricity (Figure 1.7) and heat, and are not trans¬ 
parent to visible light; a polished metal surface has a lustrous appearance. In addi¬ 
tion, some of the metals (i.e., Fe, Co, and Ni) have desirable magnetic properties. 

Figure 1.8 shows several common and familiar objects that are made of metal¬ 
lic materials. Furthermore, the types and applications of metals and their alloys are 
discussed in Chapter 11. 

Ceramics 

Ceramics are compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements; they are most 
frequently oxides, nitrides, and carbides. For example, common ceramic materials

include aluminum oxide (or alumina, A1 2 0 3 ), silicon dioxide (or silica, Si0 2 ), silicon 
carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ), and, in addition, what some refer to as the tra¬ 
ditional ceramics —those composed of clay minerals (i.e., porcelain), as well as 
cement and glass. With regard to mechanical behavior, ceramic materials are relatively 
stiff and strong—stiffnesses and strengths are comparable to those of the metals 
(Figures 1.4 and 1.5). In addition, they are typically very hard. Historically, ceramics 
have exhibited extreme brittleness (lack of ductility) and are highly susceptible to frac¬ 
ture (Figure 1.6). However, newer ceramics are being engineered to have improved 
resistance to fracture; these materials are used for cookware, cutlery, and even auto¬ 
mobile engine parts. Furthermore, ceramic materials are typically insulative to the pas¬ 
sage of heat and electricity (i.e., have low electrical conductivities, Figure 1.7), and are

Polymers 


With regard to optical characteristics, ceramics may be transparent, translucent, or 
opaque (Figure 1.2), and some of the oxide ceramics (e.g., Fe 3 0 4 ) exhibit magnetic 
behavior. 

Several common ceramic objects are shown in Figure 1.9. The characteristics, 
types, and applications of this class of materials are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13. 

Polymers 

Polymers include the familiar plastic and rubber materials. Many of them are organic 
compounds that are chemically based on carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetallic 
elements (i.e., O, N, and Si). Furthermore, they have very large molecular structures, 
often chainlike in nature, that often have a backbone of carbon atoms. Some of the 
common and familiar polymers are polyethylene (PE), nylon, poly(vinyl chloride) 
(PVC), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), and silicone rubber. These materials typ¬ 
ically have low densities (Figure 1.3), whereas their mechanical characteristics are gen¬ 
erally dissimilar to the metallic and ceramic materials—they are not as stiff nor as 
strong as these other material types (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). However, on the basis of

metal alloys (from

coins, a gear, a

nut and bolt.

their low densities, many times their stiffnesses and strengths on a per-mass basis are 
comparable to the metals and ceramics. In addition, many of the polymers are 
extremely ductile and pliable (i.e., plastic), which means they are easily formed into 
complex shapes. In general, they are relatively inert chemically and unreactive in a 
large number of environments. One major drawback to the polymers is their tendency 
to soften and/or decompose at modest temperatures, which, in some instances, limits 
their use. Furthermore, they have low electrical conductivities (Figure 1.7) and are 
nonmagnetic. 

Figure 1.10 shows several articles made of polymers that are familiar to the 
reader. Chapters 14 and 15 are devoted to discussions of the structures, properties, 
applications, and processing of polymeric materials.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Carbonated Beverage Containers 


O ne common item that presents some inter¬ 
esting material property requirements is the 
container for carbonated beverages. The material 
used for this application must satisfy the follow¬ 
ing constraints: (1) provide a barrier to the pas¬ 
sage of carbon dioxide, which is under pressure 
in the container; (2) be nontoxic, unreactive with 
the beverage, and, preferably, recyclable; (3) be 
relatively strong and capable of surviving a drop 
from a height of several feet when containing the 
beverage; (4) be inexpensive, including the cost to 
fabricate the final shape; (5) if optically transpar¬ 
ent, retain its optical clarity; and (6) be capable 
of being produced in different colors and/or 
adorned with decorative labels. 

All three of the basic material types—metal 
(aluminum), ceramic (glass), and polymer (poly¬ 
ester plastic)—are used for carbonated beverage 
containers (per the chapter-opening photographs 
for this chapter). All of these materials are non¬ 


toxic and unreactive with beverages. In addition, 
each material has its pros and cons. For example, 
the aluminum alloy is relatively strong (but easily 
dented), is a very good barrier to the diffusion of 
carbon dioxide, is easily recycled, cools beverages 
rapidly, and allows labels to be painted onto its sur¬ 
face. On the other hand, the cans are optically 
opaque and relatively expensive to produce. Glass 
is impervious to the passage of carbon dioxide, is 
a relatively inexpensive material, and may be re¬ 
cycled, but it cracks and fractures easily, and glass 
bottles are relatively heavy. Whereas plastic is rel¬ 
atively strong, may be made optically transparent, 
is inexpensive and lightweight, and is recyclable, it 
is not as impervious to the passage of carbon diox¬ 
ide as the aluminum and glass. For example, you 
may have noticed that beverages in aluminum and 
glass containers retain their carbonization (i.e., 
“fizz”) for several years, whereas those in two-liter 
plastic bottles “go flat” within a few months. 


Composites 

A composite is composed of two (or more) individual materials, which come from 
the categories previously discussed—metals, ceramics, and polymers. The design 
goal of a composite is to achieve a combination of properties that is not displayed 
by any single material, and also to incorporate the best characteristics of each of 
the component materials. A large number of composite types are represented by 
different combinations of metals, ceramics, and polymers. Furthermore, some 
naturally occurring materials are composites—for example, wood and bone. How¬ 
ever, most of those we consider in our discussions are synthetic (or human-made) 
composites. 

One of the most common and familiar composites is fiberglass, in which small 
glass fibers are embedded within a polymeric material (normally an epoxy or poly¬ 
ester). 4 The glass fibers are relatively strong and stiff (but also brittle), whereas the 
polymer is more flexible. Thus, fiberglass is relatively stiff, strong (Figures 1.4 and 
1.5), and flexible. In addition, it has a low density (Figure 1.3). 

Another technologically important material is the carbon fiber-reinforced poly¬ 
mer (CFRP) composite—carbon fibers that are embedded within a polymer. These 
materials are stiffer and stronger than glass fiber-reinforced materials (Figures 1.4 
and 1.5), but more expensive. CFRP composites are used in some aircraft and 


4 Fiberglass is sometimes also termed a “glass fiber-reinforced polymer” composite, abbre¬ 
viated GFRP. 








1.5 Advanced Materials * 11 


aerospace applications, as well as high-tech sporting equipment (e.g., bicycles, golf 
clubs, tennis rackets, and skis/snowboards) and recently in automobile bumpers. The 
new Boeing 787 fuselage is primarily made from such CFRP composites. 

Chapter 16 is devoted to a discussion of these interesting composite materials. 


1.5 ADVANCED MATERIALS 

Materials that are utilized in high-technology (or high-tech) applications are some¬ 
times termed advanced materials. By high technology we mean a device or product 
that operates or functions using relatively intricate and sophisticated principles; ex¬ 
amples include electronic equipment (camcorders, CD/DVD players, etc.), com¬ 
puters, fiber-optic systems, spacecraft, aircraft, and military rocketry. These advanced 
materials are typically traditional materials whose properties have been enhanced, 
and also newly developed, high-performance materials. Furthermore, they may be 
of all material types (e.g., metals, ceramics, polymers), and are normally expensive. 
Advanced materials include semiconductors, biomaterials, and what we may term 
“materials of the future” (that is, smart materials and nanoengineered materials), 
which we discuss next. The properties and applications of a number of these 
advanced materials—for example, materials that are used for lasers, integrated 
circuits, magnetic information storage, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and fiber 
optics—are also discussed in subsequent chapters. 

Semiconductors 

Semiconductors have electrical properties that are intermediate between the elec¬ 
trical conductors (i.e., metals and metal alloys) and insulators (i.e., ceramics and 
polymers)—see Figure 1.7. Furthermore, the electrical characteristics of these ma¬ 
terials are extremely sensitive to the presence of minute concentrations of impu¬ 
rity atoms, for which the concentrations may be controlled over very small spatial 
regions. Semiconductors have made possible the advent of integrated circuitry that 
has totally revolutionized the electronics and computer industries (not to mention 
our lives) over the past three decades. 

Biomaterials 

Biomaterials are employed in components implanted into the human body to re¬ 
place diseased or damaged body parts. These materials must not produce toxic sub¬ 
stances and must be compatible with body tissues (i.e., must not cause adverse 
biological reactions). All of the preceding materials—metals, ceramics, polymers, 
composites, and semiconductors—may be used as biomaterials. For example, some 
of the biomaterials that are utilized in artificial hip replacements are discussed in 
the online Biomaterials Module. 

Smart Materials 

Smart (or intelligent) materials are a group of new and state-of-the-art materials 
now being developed that will have a significant influence on many of our tech¬ 
nologies. The adjective smart implies that these materials are able to sense changes 
in their environment and then respond to these changes in predetermined 
manners—traits that are also found in living organisms. In addition, this “smart” 
concept is being extended to rather sophisticated systems that consist of both smart 
and traditional materials. 

Components of a smart material (or system) include some type of sensor (that 
detects an input signal), and an actuator (that performs a responsive and adaptive 


12 * Chapter 1 / Introduction 


function). Actuators may be called upon to change shape, position, natural fre¬ 
quency, or mechanical characteristics in response to changes in temperature, elec¬ 
tric fields, and/or magnetic fields. 

Four types of materials are commonly used for actuators: shape-memory alloys, 
piezoelectric ceramics, magnetostrictive materials, and electrorheological/magne- 
torheological fluids. Shape-memory alloys are metals that, after having been de¬ 
formed, revert back to their original shape when temperature is changed (see the 
Materials of Importance box following Section 10.9). Piezoelectric ceramics expand 
and contract in response to an applied electric field (or voltage); conversely, they 
also generate an electric field when their dimensions are altered (see Section 18.25). 
The behavior of magnetostrictive materials is analogous to that of the piezoelectrics, 
except that they are responsive to magnetic fields. Also, electrorheological and mag- 
netorheological fluids are liquids that experience dramatic changes in viscosity upon 
the application of electric and magnetic fields, respectively. 

Materials/devices employed as sensors include optical fibers (Section 21.14), 
piezoelectric materials (including some polymers), and microelectromechanical sys¬ 
tems (MEMS, Section 13.8). 

For example, one type of smart system is used in helicopters to reduce aero¬ 
dynamic cockpit noise that is created by the rotating rotor blades. Piezoelectric 
sensors inserted into the blades monitor blade stresses and deformations; feedback 
signals from these sensors are fed into a computer-controlled adaptive device, which 
generates noise-canceling antinoise. 

Nanomaterials 

One new material class that has fascinating properties and tremendous technolog¬ 
ical promise is the nanomaterials. Nanomaterials may be any one of the four basic 
types—metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. However, unlike these other ma¬ 
terials, they are not distinguished on the basis of their chemistry, but rather, size; 
the -prefix denotes that the dimensions of these structural entities are on the 
order of a nanometer (10 -9 m)—as a rule, less than 100 nanometers (equivalent to 
approximately 500 atom diameters). 

Prior to the advent of nanomaterials, the general procedure scientists used to 
understand the chemistry and physics of materials was to begin by studying large 
and complex structures, and then to investigate the fundamental building blocks of 
these structures that are smaller and simpler. This approach is sometimes termed 
“top-down” science. On the other hand, with the development of scanning probe 
microscopes (Section 4.10), which permit observation of individual atoms and mol¬ 
ecules, it has become possible to design and build new structures from their atomic- 
level constituents, one atom or molecule at a time (i.e., “materials by design”). This 
ability to carefully arrange atoms provides opportunities to develop mechanical, 
electrical, magnetic, and other properties that are not otherwise possible. We call 
this the “bottom-up” approach, and the study of the properties of these materials 
is termed nanotechnology. 5 

Some of the physical and chemical characteristics exhibited by matter may 
experience dramatic changes as particle size approaches atomic dimensions. For 


5 One legendary and prophetic suggestion as to the possibility of nanoengineered materials 
was offered by Richard Feynman in his 1959 American Physical Society lecture titled 
“There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” 



1.6 Modem Materials' Needs * 13 


example, materials that are opaque in the macroscopic domain may become 
transparent on the nanoscale; some solids become liquids, chemically stable materi¬ 
als become combustible, and electrical insulators become conductors. Furthermore, 
properties may depend on size in this nanoscale domain. Some of these effects are 
quantum mechanical in origin, others are related to surface phenomena—the pro¬ 
portion of atoms located on surface sites of a particle increases dramatically as its 
size decreases. 

Because of these unique and unusual properties, nanomaterials are finding 
niches in electronic, biomedical, sporting, energy production, and other industrial 
applications. Some are discussed in this book; these include the following: 

• Catalytic converters for automobiles—Materials of Importance box, 

Chapter 4 

• Carbon nanotubes—Materials of Importance box, Chapter 12 

• Particles of carbon black as reinforcement for automobile tires—Section 16.2 

• Nanocomposites in tennis balls—Materials of Importance box, Chapter 16 

• Magnetic nanosize grains that are used for hard disk drives—Section 20.11 

• Magnetic particles that store data on magnetic tapes—Section 20.11 

Whenever a new material is developed, its potential for harmful and toxico¬ 
logical interactions with humans and animals must be considered. Small nanopar¬ 
ticles have exceedingly large surface area-to-volume ratios, which can lead to high 
chemical reactivities. Although the safety of nanomaterials is relatively unexplored, 
there are concerns that they may be absorbed into the body through the skin, lungs, 
and digestive tract at relatively high rates, and that some, if present in sufficient 
concentrations, will pose health risks—such as damage to DNA or promotion of 
lung cancer. 


1.6 MODERN MATERIALS' NEEDS 

In spite of the tremendous progress that has been made in the discipline of mate¬ 
rials science and engineering within the past few years, technological challenges still 
remain, including the development of even more sophisticated and specialized ma¬ 
terials, as well as consideration of the environmental impact of materials produc¬ 
tion. Some comment is appropriate relative to these issues so as to round out this 
perspective. 

Nuclear energy holds some promise, but the solutions to the many problems 
that remain will necessarily involve materials, such as fuels, containment structures, 
and facilities for the disposal of radioactive waste. 

Significant quantities of energy are involved in transportation. Reducing the 
weight of transportation vehicles (automobiles, aircraft, trains, etc.), as well as 
increasing engine operating temperatures, will enhance fuel efficiency. New high- 
strength, low-density structural materials remain to be developed, as well as mate¬ 
rials that have higher-temperature capabilities, for use in engine components. 

Furthermore, there is a recognized need to find new, economical sources of 
energy and to use present resources more efficiently. Materials will undoubtedly 
play a significant role in these developments. For example, the direct conversion 
of solar power into electrical energy has been demonstrated. Solar cells employ 
some rather complex and expensive materials. To ensure a viable technology, 


14 * Chapter 1 / Introduction 


materials that are highly efficient in this conversion process yet less costly must 
be developed. 

The hydrogen fuel cell is another very attractive and feasible energy- 
conversion technology that has the advantage of being nonpolluting. It is just 
beginning to be implemented in batteries for electronic devices and holds prom¬ 
ise as a power plant for automobiles. New materials still need to be developed 
for more efficient fuel cells and also for better catalysts to be used in the pro¬ 
duction of hydrogen. 

Furthermore, environmental quality depends on our ability to control air and 
water pollution. Pollution control techniques employ various materials. In addition, 
materials processing and refinement methods need to be improved so that they pro¬ 
duce less environmental degradation—that is, less pollution and less despoilage of 
the landscape from the mining of raw materials. Also, in some materials manufac¬ 
turing processes, toxic substances are produced, and the ecological impact of their 
disposal must be considered. 

Many materials that we use are derived from resources that are nonrenewable— 
that is, not capable of being regenerated. These include most polymers, for which 
the prime raw material is oil, and some metals. These nonrenewable resources are 
gradually becoming depleted, which necessitates (1) the discovery of additional re¬ 
serves, (2) the development of new materials having comparable properties with 
less adverse environmental impact, and/or (3) increased recycling efforts and the 
development of new recycling technologies. As a consequence of the economics of 
not only production but also environmental impact and ecological factors, it is be¬ 
coming increasingly important to consider the “cradle-to-grave” life cycle of mate¬ 
rials relative to the overall manufacturing process. 

The roles that materials scientists and engineers play relative to these, as well 
as other environmental and societal issues, are discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 22. 


1.7 PROCESSING/STRUCTURE/PROPERTIES/ 

PERFORMANCE CORRELATIONS 

As mentioned previously (Section 1.2), the science and engineering of materials 
involves four interrelated components: processing, structure, properties, and per¬ 
formance (Figure 1.1). Inasmuch as the remainder of the book discusses these com¬ 
ponents for the different material types, it has been decided to direct the readers’ 
attention to the treatment of individual components for several specific materials. 
Whereas some of these discussions are found within single chapters, others are 
spread out over multiple chapters. For the latter, and for each material we have se¬ 
lected, a “topic timeline” has been created that indicates the locations (by sections) 
where treatments of the four components are to be found. Figure 1.11 presents topic 
timelines for the following materials: steels, glass-ceramics, polymer fibers, and sil¬ 
icon semiconductors. In addition, at the beginning of each chapter (in the Why 
Study? section), we note those materials that have some aspect of their processing, 
structure, properties, and/or performance discussed in that chapter. And, finally, a 
processing/structure/properties/performance summary appears at the end of that 
chapter in which the last item on the topic timeline appears—for example, Chapter 11 
for steels, Chapter 13 for glass-ceramics, Chapter 15 for polymer fibers, and 
Chapter 18 for silicon semiconductors.

SUMMARY 


Materials Science and Engineering 

• There are six different property classifications of materials that determine their 
applicability: mechanical, electrical, thermal, magnetic, optical, and deteriorative. 

• One aspect of materials science is the investigation of relationships that exist be¬ 
tween the structures and properties of materials. By structure we mean how some 
internal component(s) of the material is (are) arranged. In terms of (and with 
increasing) dimensionality, structural elements include subatomic, atomic, micro¬ 
scopic, and macroscopic. 

• With regard to the design, production, and utilization of materials, there are four 
elements to consider—processing, structure, properties, and performance. The per¬ 
formance of a material depends on its properties, which in turn are a function of 
its structure(s); furthermore, structure(s) is (are) determined by how the mate¬ 
rial was processed. 

• Three important criteria in materials selection are in-service conditions to which 
the material will be subjected, any deterioration of material properties during 
operation, and economics or cost of the fabricated piece. 

Classification of Materials 

• On the basis of chemistry and atomic structure, materials are classified into three 
general categories: metals (metallic elements), ceramics (compounds between 
metallic and nonmetallic elements), and polymers (compounds composed of 
carbon, hydrogen, and other nonmetallic elements). In addition, composites are 
composed of at least two different material types. 

Advanced Materials 

• Another materials category is the advanced materials that are used in high-tech 
applications. These include semiconductors (having electrical conductivities in¬ 
termediate between conductors and insulators), biomaterials (which must be com¬ 
patible with body tissues), smart materials (those that sense and respond to 
changes in their environments in predetermined manners), and nanomaterials 
(those that have structural features on the order of a nanometer, some of which 
may be designed on the atomic/molecular level).

T he photograph at the bottom of this page is of 
a gecko. 

Geckos, harmless tropical lizards, are extremely fasci¬ 
nating and extraordinary animals. They have very sticky 
feet (one of which is shown in the center-left photo¬ 
graph) that cling to virtually any surface. This characteris¬ 
tic makes it possible for them to rapidly run up vertical 
walls and along the undersides of horizontal surfaces. In 
fact, a gecko can support its body mass with a single toe! 
The secret to this remarkable ability is the presence of an 
extremely large number of microscopically small hairs on each of their toe pads. 

When these hairs come in contact with a surface, weak forces of attraction (i.e., van 
der Waals forces) are established between hair molecules and molecules on the sur¬ 
face. The fact that these hairs are so small and so numerous explains why the gecko 
grips surfaces so tightly. To release its grip, the gecko simply curls up its toes and 
peels the hairs away from the surface. 

Using their knowledge of this mechanism of adhesion, scientists have developed 
several ultra-strong synthetic adhesives. One of these is an adhesive tape (shown in 

the upper-left photograph), 
which is an especially promising 
tool for use in surgical proce¬ 
dures as a replacement for 
sutures and staples to close 
wounds and incisions. This 
material retains its adhesive 
nature in wet environments, is 
biodegradable, and does not 
release toxic substances as it 
dissolves during the healing 
process. Microscopic features of 
this adhesive tape are shown in 
the top-center photograph.

WHY STUDY Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding? 


An important reason to have an understanding of 
interatomic bonding in solids is that in some instances, 
the type of bond allows us to explain a material's 
properties. For example, consider carbon, which may 
exist as both graphite and diamond. Whereas graphite 
is relatively soft and has a "greasy" feel to it, diamond 
is the hardest known material. In addition, the electrical 
properties of diamond and graphite are dissimilar: 
diamond is a poor conductor of electricity, but 
graphite is a reasonably good conductor. These dispari¬ 
ties in properties are directly attributable to a type of 
interatomic bonding found in graphite that does not 
exist in diamond (see Section 12.4). 


In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying atomic structure and in¬ 
teratomic bonding are as follows: 

• For silicon, its electron configuration (Section 2.3) 
determines the type of primary bonding (Section 
2.6), which in turn affects its electron band structure 
(Chapter 18). 

• For polymer fibers, electron configurations of the 
constituent elements (i.e., C, H; Section 2.3) affect 
the type of primary bonding (Section 2.6); bonding 
type has an influence on the structures of polymer 
molecules (Chapter 14).

2.1 INTRODUCTION 

Some of the important properties of solid materials depend on geometrical atomic 
arrangements, and also the interactions that exist among constituent atoms or mol¬ 
ecules. This chapter, by way of preparation for subsequent discussions, considers 
several fundamental and important concepts—namely, atomic structure, electron 
configurations in atoms and the periodic table, and the various types of primary 
and secondary interatomic bonds that hold together the atoms that compose a solid. 
These topics are reviewed briefly, under the assumption that some of the material 
is familiar to the reader. 

Atomic Structure 


2.2 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 

Each atom consists of a very small nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, which 
is encircled by moving electrons. Both electrons and protons are electrically charged, 
the charge magnitude being 1.602 X 10 -19 C, which is negative in sign for electrons 
and positive for protons; neutrons are electrically neutral. Masses for these sub¬ 
atomic particles are infinitesimally small; protons and neutrons have approximately

the same mass, 1.67 X 10 -27 kg, which is significantly larger than that of an elec¬ 
tron, 9.11 X 10 -31 kg. 

Each chemical element is characterized by the number of protons in the nu¬ 
cleus, or the atomic number (Z ). 1 For an electrically neutral or complete atom, the 
atomic number also equals the number of electrons. This atomic number ranges in 
integral units from 1 for hydrogen to 92 for uranium, the highest of the naturally 
occurring elements. 

The atomic mass (A) of a specific atom may be expressed as the sum of the 
masses of protons and neutrons within the nucleus. Although the number of pro¬ 
tons is the same for all atoms of a given element, the number of neutrons ( N ) may 
be variable. Thus atoms of some elements have two or more different atomic masses, 
which are called isotopes. The atomic weight of an element corresponds to the 
weighted average of the atomic masses of the atom’s naturally occurring isotopes. 2 
The atomic mass unit (amu) may be used to compute atomic weight. A scale has 
been established whereby 1 amu is defined as \ 2 of the atomic mass of the most 
common isotope of carbon, carbon 12 ( 12 C) (A = 12.00000). Within this scheme, the 
masses of protons and neutrons are slightly greater than unity, and 

A = Z + N (2.1) 

The atomic weight of an element or the molecular weight of a compound may be 
specified on the basis of amu per atom (molecule) or mass per mole of material. In 
one mole of a substance there are 6.022 X 10 23 (Avogadro’s number) atoms or mol¬ 
ecules. These two atomic weight schemes are related through the following equation: 

1 amu/atom (or molecule) = 1 g/mol 

For example, the atomic weight of iron is 55.85 amu/atom, or 55.85 g/mol. Some¬ 
times use of amu per atom or molecule is convenient; on other occasions grams (or 
kilograms) per mole is preferred. The latter is used in this book.

2.3 ELECTRONS IN ATOMS 

Atomic Models 

During the latter part of the nineteenth century it was realized that many phe¬ 
nomena involving electrons in solids could not be explained in terms of classical 
mechanics. What followed was the establishment of a set of principles and laws that 
govern systems of atomic and subatomic entities that came to be known as quan- 
quantum mechanics turn mechanics. An understanding of the behavior of electrons in atoms and crys¬ 
talline solids necessarily involves the discussion of quantum-mechanical concepts. 


^erms appearing in boldface type are defined in the Glossary, which follows Appendix E. 

2 The term atomic mass is really more accurate than atomic weight inasmuch as, in this con¬ 
text, we are dealing with masses and not weights. However, atomic weight is, by conven¬ 
tion, the preferred terminology and will be used throughout this book. The reader should 
note that it is not necessary to divide molecular weight by the gravitational constant.

However, a detailed exploration of these principles is beyond the scope of this book, 
and only a very superficial and simplified treatment is given. 

One early outgrowth of quantum mechanics was the simplified Bohr atomic 
model, in which electrons are assumed to revolve around the atomic nucleus in dis¬ 
crete orbitals, and the position of any particular electron is more or less well de¬ 
fined in terms of its orbital. This model of the atom is represented in Figure 2.1. 

Another important quantum-mechanical principle stipulates that the energies of 
electrons are quantized; that is, electrons are permitted to have only specific values 
of energy. An electron may change energy, but in doing so it must make a quantum 
jump either to an allowed higher energy (with absorption of energy) or to a lower 
energy (with emission of energy). Often, it is convenient to think of these allowed 
electron energies as being associated with energy levels or states. These states do 
not vary continuously with energy; that is, adjacent states are separated by finite 
energies. For example, allowed states for the Bohr hydrogen atom are represented 
in Figure 2.2 a. These energies are taken to be negative, whereas the zero reference

is the unbound or free electron. Of course, the single electron associated with the 
hydrogen atom will fill only one of these states. 

Thus, the Bohr model represents an early attempt to describe electrons in atoms, 
in terms of both position (electron orbitals) and energy (quantized energy levels). 

This Bohr model was eventually found to have some significant limitations be¬ 
cause of its inability to explain several phenomena involving electrons. A resolution 
was reached with a wave-mechanical model, in which the electron is considered to 
exhibit both wavelike and particle-like characteristics. With this model, an electron 
is no longer treated as a particle moving in a discrete orbital; rather, position is con¬ 
sidered to be the probability of an electron’s being at various locations around the 
nucleus. In other words, position is described by a probability distribution or elec¬ 
tron cloud. Figure 2.3 compares Bohr and wave-mechanical models for the hydrogen 
atom. Both of these models are used throughout the course of this book; the choice 
depends on which model allows the more simple explanation. 

Quantum Numbers 

Using wave mechanics, every electron in an atom is characterized by four pa¬ 
rameters called quantum numbers. The size, shape, and spatial orientation of an 
electron’s probability density are specified by three of these quantum numbers. 
Furthermore, Bohr energy levels separate into electron subshells, and quantum 
numbers dictate the number of states within each subshell. Shells are specified by

a principal quantum number n , which may take on integral values beginning with 
unity; sometimes these shells are designated by the letters K , L, M , TV, O , and so 
on, which correspond, respectively, to n = 1, 2, 3,4, 5,..., as indicated in Table 2.1. 
Note also that this quantum number, and it only, is also associated with the Bohr 
model. This quantum number is related to the distance of an electron from the nu¬ 
cleus, or its position. 

The second quantum number, /, signifies the subshell, which is denoted by a 
lowercase letter—an s,p , d , or/; it is related to the shape of the electron subshell. 
In addition, the number of these subshells is restricted by the magnitude of n. 
Allowable subshells for the several n values are also presented in Table 2.1. The num¬ 
ber of energy states for each subshell is determined by the third quantum number, 
m z . For an s subshell, there is a single energy state, whereas for p , d , and / subshells, 
three, five, and seven states exist, respectively (Table 2.1). In the absence of an ex¬ 
ternal magnetic field, the states within each subshell are identical. However, when 
a magnetic field is applied, these subshell states split, with each state assuming a 
slightly different energy. 

Associated with each electron is a spin moment , which must be oriented either 
up or down. Related to this spin moment is the fourth quantum number, m s , for 
which two values are possible (+2 and - |), one for each of the spin orientations. 

Thus, the Bohr model was further refined by wave mechanics, in which the in¬ 
troduction of three new quantum numbers gives rise to electron subshells within 
each shell. A comparison of these two models on this basis is illustrated, for the hy¬ 
drogen atom, in Figures 2.2 a and 2.2 b. 

A complete energy level diagram for the various shells and subshells using 
the wave-mechanical model is shown in Figure 2.4. Several features of the dia¬ 
gram are worth noting. First, the smaller the principal quantum number, the lower 
the energy level; for example, the energy of a Is state is less than that of a 2s state, 
which in turn is lower than the 3s. Second, within each shell, the energy of a sub¬ 
shell level increases with the value of the / quantum number. For example, the 
energy of a 3d state is greater than a 3 p, which is larger than 3s. Finally, there may 
be overlap in energy of a state in one shell with states in an adjacent shell, which 
is especially true of d and /states; for example, the energy of a 3d state is generally 
greater than that for a 4s.

Electron Configurations 

The preceding discussion has dealt primarily with electron states— values of energy 
that are permitted for electrons. To determine the manner in which these states are 
filled with electrons, we use the Pauli exclusion principle, another quantum-mechanical 
concept. This principle stipulates that each electron state can hold no more than two 
electrons, which must have opposite spins. Thus, s,p , d , and / subshells may each ac¬ 
commodate, respectively, a total of 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons; Table 2.1 summarizes 
the maximum number of electrons that may occupy each of the first four shells. 

Of course, not all possible states in an atom are filled with electrons. For most 
atoms, the electrons fill up the lowest possible energy states in the electron shells and 
subshells, two electrons (having opposite spins) per state. The energy structure for a 
sodium atom is represented schematically in Figure 2.5. When all the electrons occupy 
the lowest possible energies in accord with the foregoing restrictions, an atom is said 
to be in its ground state. However, electron transitions to higher energy states are 
possible, as discussed in Chapters 18 and 21. The electron configuration or structure 
of an atom represents the manner in which these states are occupied. In the conven¬ 
tional notation the number of electrons in each subshell is indicated by a superscript 
after the shell-subshell designation. For example, the electron configurations for

a When some elements covalently bond, they form sp hybrid bonds. This is espe¬ 
cially true for C, Si, and Ge. 


hydrogen, helium, and sodium are, respectively, Is 1 , Is 2 , and lv 2 2v 2 2/7 6 3v 1 . Electron 
configurations for some of the more common elements are listed in Table 2.2. 

At this point, comments regarding these electron configurations are necessary. 
First, the valence electrons are those that occupy the outermost shell. These elec¬ 
trons are extremely important; as will be seen, they participate in the bonding be¬ 
tween atoms to form atomic and molecular aggregates. Furthermore, many of the 
physical and chemical properties of solids are based on these valence electrons. 

In addition, some atoms have what are termed stable electron configurations; 
that is, the states within the outermost or valence electron shell are completely 





26 * Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding 


filled. Normally this corresponds to the occupation of just the s and p states for 
the outermost shell by a total of eight electrons, as in neon, argon, and krypton; 
one exception is helium, which contains only two Is electrons. These elements 
(Ne, Ar, Kr, and He) are the inert, or noble, gases, which are virtually unreactive 
chemically. Some atoms of the elements that have unfilled valence shells assume 
stable electron configurations by gaining or losing electrons to form charged ions, 
or by sharing electrons with other atoms. This is the basis for some chemical re¬ 
actions, and also for atomic bonding in solids, as explained in Section 2.6. 

Under special circumstances, the s and p orbitals combine to form hybrid sp n 
orbitals, where n indicates the number of p orbitals involved, which may have a 
value of 1, 2, or 3. The III A, IVA, and VA group elements of the periodic table 
(Figure 2.6) are those that most often form these hybrids. The driving force for the 
formation of hybrid orbitals is a lower energy state for the valence electrons. For 
carbon the sp 3 hybrid is of primary importance in organic and polymer chemistries. 
The shape of the sp 3 hybrid is what determines the 109° (or tetrahedral) angle 
found frequently in polymer chains (Chapter 14).

2A THE PERIODIC TABLE 


periodic table 


electropositive 


electronegative 


All the elements have been classified according to electron configuration in the 
periodic table (Figure 2.6). Here, the elements are situated, with increasing 
atomic number, in seven horizontal rows called periods. The arrangement is such 
that all elements arrayed in a given column or group have similar valence elec¬ 
tron structures, as well as chemical and physical properties. These properties 
change gradually, moving horizontally across each period and vertically down 
each column. 

The elements positioned in Group 0, the rightmost group, are the inert gases, 
which have filled electron shells and stable electron configurations. Group VIIA 
and VIA elements are one and two electrons deficient, respectively, from having 
stable structures. The Group VIIA elements (F, Cl, Br, I, and At) are sometimes 
termed the halogens. The alkali and the alkaline earth metals (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, 
Ca, etc.) are labeled as Groups IA and II A, having, respectively, one and two elec¬ 
trons in excess of stable structures. The elements in the three long periods, Groups 
IIIB through IIB, are termed the transition metals, which have partially filled d elec¬ 
tron states and in some cases one or two electrons in the next higher energy shell. 
Groups IIIA, IVA, and VA (B, Si, Ge, As, etc.) display characteristics that are in¬ 
termediate between the metals and nonmetals by virtue of their valence electron 
structures. 

As may be noted from the periodic table, most of the elements really come un¬ 
der the metal classification. These are sometimes termed electropositive elements, 
indicating that they are capable of giving up their few valence electrons to become 
positively charged ions. Furthermore, the elements situated on the right-hand side of 
the table are electronegative; that is, they readily accept electrons to form negatively

Atomic Bonding in Solids 

2.5 BONDING FORCES AND ENERGIES 

An understanding of many of the physical properties of materials is enhanced by 
a knowledge of the interatomic forces that bind the atoms together. Perhaps the 
principles of atomic bonding are best illustrated by considering how two isolated 
atoms interact as they are brought close together from an infinite separation. At 
large distances, interactions are negligible, because the atoms are too far apart to 
have an influence on each other; however, at small separation distances, each atom 
exerts forces on the other. These forces are of two types, attractive (F A ) and repul¬ 
sive (F r ), and the magnitude of each depends on the separation or interatomic 
distance (r); Figure 2.8 a is a schematic plot of F A and F R versus r. The origin of an 
attractive force F A depends on the particular type of bonding that exists between 
the two atoms, as discussed shortly. Repulsive forces arise from interactions between 
the negatively charged electron clouds for the two atoms and are important only 
at small values of r as the outer electron shells of the two atoms begin to overlap 
(Figure 2.8a).

2.5 Bonding Forces and Energies * 29 


The net force F n between the two atoms is just the sum of both attractive and 
repulsive components; that is, 


F n = F a + F r (2.2) 

which is also a function of the interatomic separation, as also plotted in Figure 2.8a. 
When F a and F R balance, or become equal, there is no net force; that is,

and a state of equilibrium exists. The centers of the two atoms will remain sepa¬ 
rated by the equilibrium spacing r 0 , as indicated in Figure 2.8a. For many atoms, r 0 
is approximately 0.3 nm. Once in this position, any attempt to move the two atoms 
farther apart will be counteracted by the attractive force, while pushing them closer 
together will be resisted by the increasing repulsive force. 

Sometimes it is more convenient to work with the potential energies between 
two atoms instead of forces. Mathematically, energy ( E ) and force (F) are related as

in which and E r are respectively the net, attractive, and repulsive energies 

for two isolated and adjacent atoms. 

Figure 2.8 b plots attractive, repulsive, and net potential energies as a function 
of interatomic separation for two atoms. From Equation 2.7, the net curve is the 
sum of the attractive and repulsive curves. The minimum in the net energy curve 
corresponds to the equilibrium spacing, r 0 . Furthermore, the bonding energy for 
these two atoms, E 0 , corresponds to the energy at this minimum point (also shown 
in Figure 2.8 b); it represents the energy that would be required to separate these 
two atoms to an infinite separation. 

Although the preceding treatment deals with an ideal situation involving only 
two atoms, a similar yet more complex condition exists for solid materials be¬ 
cause force and energy interactions among many atoms must be considered. Nev¬ 
ertheless, a bonding energy, analogous to E 0 above, may be associated with each 
atom. The magnitude of this bonding energy and the shape of the energy-versus- 
interatomic separation curve vary from material to material, and they both 
depend on the type of atomic bonding. Furthermore, a number of material properties 
depend on E 0 , the curve shape, and bonding type. For example, materials having 
large bonding energies typically also have high melting temperatures; at room 
temperature, solid substances are formed for large bonding energies, whereas for 
small energies the gaseous state is favored; liquids prevail when the energies are 
of intermediate magnitude. In addition, as discussed in Section 6.3, the mechan¬ 
ical stiffness (or modulus of elasticity) of a material is dependent on the shape 


30 * Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding 


of its force-versus-interatomic separation curve (Figure 6.7). The slope for a rel¬ 
atively stiff material at the r = r 0 position on the curve will be quite steep; slopes 
are shallower for more flexible materials. Furthermore, how much a material 
expands upon heating or contracts upon cooling (that is, its linear coefficient 
of thermal expansion) is related to the shape of its E 0 -versus-r 0 curve (see Sec¬ 
tion 19.3). A deep and narrow “trough,” which typically occurs for materials 
having large bonding energies, normally correlates with a low coefficient of 
thermal expansion and relatively small dimensional alterations for changes in 
temperature. 

primary bond Three different types of primary or chemical bond are found in solids —ionic, 

covalent, and metallic. For each type, the bonding necessarily involves the valence 
electrons; furthermore, the nature of the bond depends on the electron structures 
of the constituent atoms. In general, each of these three types of bonding arises 
from the tendency of the atoms to assume stable electron structures, like those of 
the inert gases, by completely filling the outermost electron shell. 

Secondary or physical forces and energies are also found in many solid mate¬ 
rials; they are weaker than the primary ones, but nonetheless influence the physi¬ 
cal properties of some materials. The sections that follow explain the several kinds 
of primary and secondary interatomic bonds. 

2.6 PRIMARY INTERATOMIC BONDS 

Ionic Bonding 

ionic bonding Ionic bonding is perhaps the easiest to describe and visualize. It is always found 

in compounds that are composed of both metallic and nonmetallic elements, ele¬ 
ments that are situated at the horizontal extremities of the periodic table. Atoms 
of a metallic element easily give up their valence electrons to the nonmetallic 
atoms. In the process all the atoms acquire stable or inert gas configurations and, 
in addition, an electrical charge; that is, they become ions. Sodium chloride (NaCl) 
is the classic ionic material. A sodium atom can assume the electron structure of 
neon (and a net single positive charge) by a transfer of its one valence 3s elec¬ 
tron to a chlorine atom. After such a transfer, the chlorine ion has a net negative 
charge and an electron configuration identical to that of argon. In sodium chlo¬ 
ride, all the sodium and chlorine exist as ions. This type of bonding is illustrated 
schematically in Figure 2.9. 

coulombic force The attractive bonding forces are coulombic; that is, positive and negative 

ions, by virtue of their net electrical charge, attract one another. For two

isolated ions, the attractive energy E A is a function of the interatomic distance 
according to 3 


E a = Ij (2.8) 

An analogous equation for the repulsive energy is 4 

(2-9) 

In these expressions, A , B , and n are constants whose values depend on the partic¬ 
ular ionic system. The value of n is approximately 8. 

Ionic bonding is termed nondirectional; that is, the magnitude of the bond is equal 
in all directions around an ion. It follows that for ionic materials to be stable, all 
positive ions must have as nearest neighbors negatively charged ions in a three- 
dimensional scheme, and vice versa. The predominant bonding in ceramic materials is 
ionic. Some of the ion arrangements for these materials are discussed in Chapter 12. 

Bonding energies, which generally range between 600 and 1500 kJ/mol (3 and 
8 eV/atom), are relatively large, as reflected in high melting temperatures. 5 Table 2.3

5 Sometimes bonding energies are expressed per atom or per ion. Under these circum¬ 
stances the electron volt (eV) is a conveniently small unit of energy. It is, by definition, the 
energy imparted to an electron as it falls through an electric potential of one volt. The 
joule equivalent of the electron volt is as follows: 1.602 X 10” 19 J = 1 eV.

contains bonding energies and melting temperatures for several ionic materials. 
Ionic materials are characteristically hard and brittle and, furthermore, electri¬ 
cally and thermally insulative. As discussed in subsequent chapters, these prop¬ 
erties are a direct consequence of electron configurations and/or the nature of the 
ionic bond. 

Covalent Bonding 

In covalent bonding, stable electron configurations are assumed by the sharing 
of electrons between adjacent atoms. Two atoms that are covalently bonded will 
each contribute at least one electron to the bond, and the shared electrons may 
be considered to belong to both atoms. Covalent bonding is schematically il¬ 
lustrated in Figure 2.10 for a molecule of methane (CH 4 ). The carbon atom has 
four valence electrons, whereas each of the four hydrogen atoms has a single 
valence electron. Each hydrogen atom can acquire a helium electron configu¬ 
ration (two Is valence electrons) when the carbon atom shares with it one elec¬ 
tron. The carbon now has four additional shared electrons, one from each 
hydrogen, for a total of eight valence electrons, and the electron structure of 
neon. The covalent bond is directional; that is, it is between specific atoms and 
may exist only in the direction between one atom and another that participates 
in the electron sharing. 

Many nonmetallic elemental molecules (H 2 , Cl 2 , F 2 , etc.) as well as mole¬ 
cules containing dissimilar atoms, such as CH 4 , H 2 0, HN0 3 , and HF, are cova¬ 
lently bonded. Furthermore, this type of bonding is found in elemental solids 
such as diamond (carbon), silicon, and germanium and other solid compounds 
composed of elements that are located on the right-hand side of the periodic 
table, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium antimonide (InSb), and silicon 
carbide (SiC). 

The number of covalent bonds that is possible for a particular atom is deter¬ 
mined by the number of valence electrons. For N' valence electrons, an atom can 
covalently bond with at most 8 - N' other atoms. For example, N' = 7 for chlo¬ 
rine, and 8 - N' = 1, which means that one Cl atom can bond to only one other 
atom, as in Cl 2 . Similarly, for carbon, N' = 4, and each carbon atom has 8 - 4, or

metallic bonding 


four, electrons to share. Diamond is simply the three-dimensional interconnecting 
structure wherein each carbon atom covalently bonds with four other carbon atoms. 
This arrangement is represented in Figure 12.15. 

Covalent bonds may be very strong, as in diamond, which is very hard and has 
a very high melting temperature, > 3550°C (6400°F), or they may be very weak, as 
with bismuth, which melts at about 270°C (518°F). Bonding energies and melting 
temperatures for a few covalently bonded materials are presented in Table 2.3. Poly¬ 
meric materials typify this bond, the basic molecular structure often being a long 
chain of carbon atoms that are covalently bonded together with two of their avail¬ 
able four bonds per atom. The remaining two bonds normally are shared with other 
atoms, which also covalently bond. Polymeric molecular structures are discussed in 
detail in Chapter 14. 

It is possible to have interatomic bonds that are partially ionic and partially co¬ 
valent, and, in fact, very few compounds exhibit pure ionic or covalent bonding. For 
a compound, the degree of either bond type depends on the relative positions of 
the constituent atoms in the periodic table (Figure 2.6) or the difference in their 
electronegativities (Figure 2.7). The wider the separation (both horizontally— 
relative to Group IVA—and vertically) from the lower left to the upper right-hand 
corner (i.e., the greater the difference in electronegativity), the more ionic the bond. 
Conversely, the closer the atoms are together (i.e., the smaller the difference in elec¬ 
tronegativity), the greater the degree of covalency. The percent ionic character 
(%IC) of a bond between elements A and B (A being the most electronegative) 
may be approximated by the expression 

% ionic character ={1 - exp[-(0.25 )(X A - X B ) 2 ]} X 100 (2.10) 

where X A and X B are the electronegativities for the respective elements. 


Metallic Bonding 

Metallic bonding, the final primary bonding type, is found in metals and their al¬ 
loys. A relatively simple model has been proposed that very nearly approximates 
the bonding scheme. Metallic materials have one, two, or at most, three valence elec¬ 
trons. With this model, these valence electrons are not bound to any particular atom 
in the solid and are more or less free to drift throughout the entire metal. They may 
be thought of as belonging to the metal as a whole, or forming a “sea of electrons” 
or an “electron cloud.” The remaining nonvalence electrons and atomic nuclei form 
what are called ion cores, which possess a net positive charge equal in magnitude 
to the total valence electron charge per atom. Figure 2.11 is a schematic illustration 
of metallic bonding. The free electrons shield the positively charged ion cores from 
mutually repulsive electrostatic forces, which they would otherwise exert upon one 
another; consequently the metallic bond is nondirectional in character. In addition, 
these free electrons act as a “glue” to hold the ion cores together. Bonding ener¬ 
gies and melting temperatures for several metals are listed in Table 2.3. Bonding 
may be weak or strong; energies range from 68 kJ/mol (0.7 eV/atom) for mercury 
to 849 kJ/mol (8.8 eV/atom) for tungsten. Their respective melting temperatures 
are -39 and 3410°C (-38 and 6170°F). 

Metallic bonding is found in the periodic table for Group IA and IIA elements 
and, in fact, for all elemental metals. 


34 * Chapter 2 / Atomic Structure and Interatomic Bonding 


Ion cores 



Figure 2.11 Schematic illustration of metallic 
bonding. 


Some general behaviors of the various material types (i.e., metals, ceramics, 
polymers) may be explained by bonding type. For example, metals are good con¬ 
ductors of both electricity and heat, as a consequence of their free electrons (see 
Sections 18.5,18.6, and 19.4). By way of contrast, ionically and covalently bonded 
materials are typically electrical and thermal insulators because of the absence of 
large numbers of free electrons. 

Furthermore, in Section 7.4 we note that at room temperature, most metals and 
their alloys fail in a ductile manner; that is, fracture occurs after the materials have 
experienced significant degrees of permanent deformation. This behavior is ex¬ 
plained in terms of deformation mechanism (Section 7.2), which is implicitly related 
to the characteristics of the metallic bond. Conversely, at room temperature ioni¬ 
cally bonded materials are intrinsically brittle as a consequence of the electrically 
charged nature of their component ions (see Section 12.10).

secondary bond Secondary, van der Waals, or physical bonds are weak in comparison to the primary 

van der Waals bond or chemical ones; bonding energies are typically on the order of only 10 kJ/mol 

(0.1 eV/atom). Secondary bonding exists between virtually all atoms or molecules, 
but its presence may be obscured if any of the three primary bonding types is

present. Secondary bonding is evidenced for the inert gases, which have stable elec¬ 
tron structures, and, in addition, between molecules in molecular structures that are 
covalently bonded. 

Secondary bonding forces arise from atomic or molecular dipoles. In essence, 
an electric dipole exists whenever there is some separation of positive and nega¬ 
tive portions of an atom or molecule. The bonding results from the coulombic 
attraction between the positive end of one dipole and the negative region of an 
adjacent one, as indicated in Figure 2.12. Dipole interactions occur between 
induced dipoles, between induced dipoles and polar molecules (which have 
permanent dipoles), and between polar molecules. Hydrogen bonding, a special 
type of secondary bonding, is found to exist between some molecules that have 
hydrogen as one of the constituents. These bonding mechanisms are now 
discussed briefly. 


Fluctuating Induced Dipole Bonds 

A dipole may be created or induced in an atom or molecule that is normally elec¬ 
trically symmetric; that is, the overall spatial distribution of the electrons is sym¬ 
metric with respect to the positively charged nucleus, as shown in Figure 2.13a. 
All atoms are experiencing constant vibrational motion that can cause instanta¬ 
neous and short-lived distortions of this electrical symmetry for some of the atoms 
or molecules, and the creation of small electric dipoles, as represented in Figure 
2.13 b. One of these dipoles can in turn produce a displacement of the electron 
distribution of an adjacent molecule or atom, which induces the second one also 
to become a dipole that is then weakly attracted or bonded to the first; this is 
one type of van der Waals bonding. These attractive forces may exist between 
large numbers of atoms or molecules, which forces are temporary and fluctuate 
with time. 

The liquefaction and, in some cases, the solidification of the inert gases and 
other electrically neutral and symmetric molecules such as H 2 and Cl 2 are realized 
because of this type of bonding. Melting and boiling temperatures are extremely 
low in materials for which induced dipole bonding predominates; of all possible

intermolecular bonds, these are the weakest. Bonding energies and melting tem¬ 
peratures for argon and chlorine are also tabulated in Table 2.3. 


Polar Molecule-Induced Dipole Bonds 

Permanent dipole moments exist in some molecules by virtue of an asymmetrical 
arrangement of positively and negatively charged regions; such molecules are 
termed polar molecules. Figure 2.14 is a schematic representation of a hydrogen 
chloride molecule; a permanent dipole moment arises from net positive and nega¬ 
tive charges that are respectively associated with the hydrogen and chlorine ends 
of the HC1 molecule. 

Polar molecules can also induce dipoles in adjacent nonpolar molecules, and 
a bond will form as a result of attractive forces between the two molecules. Fur¬ 
thermore, the magnitude of this bond will be greater than for fluctuating induced 
dipoles. 

Permanent Dipole Bonds 

Van der Waals forces will also exist between adjacent polar molecules. The associ¬ 
ated bonding energies are significantly greater than for bonds involving induced 
dipoles. 

The strongest secondary bonding type, the hydrogen bond, is a special case of 
polar molecule bonding. It occurs between molecules in which hydrogen is cova¬ 
lently bonded to fluorine (as in HF), oxygen (as in H 2 0), and nitrogen (as in NH 3 ). 
For each H—F, H—O, or H—N bond, the single hydrogen electron is shared with 
the other atom. Thus, the hydrogen end of the bond is essentially a positively 
charged bare proton that is unscreened by any electrons. This highly positively 
charged end of the molecule is capable of a strong attractive force with the nega¬ 
tive end of an adjacent molecule, as demonstrated in Figure 2.15 for HF. In essence, 
this single proton forms a bridge between two negatively charged atoms. The mag¬ 
nitude of the hydrogen bond is generally greater than that of the other types of 
secondary bonds and may be as high as 51 kJ/mol (0.52 eV/molecule), as shown 
in Table 2.3. Melting and boiling temperatures for hydrogen fluoride and water are 
abnormally high in light of their low molecular weights, as a consequence of 
hydrogen bonding.

bonding in hydrogen fluoride (HF).

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 



Water (its Volume Expansion Upon Freezing) 


U pon freezing (i.e., transforming from a liq¬ 
uid to a solid upon cooling), most substances 
experience an increase in density (or, corre¬ 
spondingly, a decrease in volume). One exception 
is water, which exhibits the anomalous and fa¬ 
miliar expansion upon freezing —approximately 
9 volume percent expansion. This behavior may 
be explained on the basis of hydrogen bonding. 
Each H 2 0 molecule has two hydrogen atoms that 
can bond to oxygen atoms; in addition, its single 
O atom can bond to two hydrogen atoms of other 
H 2 0 molecules. Thus, for solid ice, each water 
molecule participates in four hydrogen bonds as 
shown in the three-dimensional schematic of 
Figure 2.16a; here hydrogen bonds are denoted 
by dashed lines, and each water molecule has 4 
nearest-neighbor molecules. This is a relatively 
open structure —that is, the molecules are not 
closely packed together —and, as a result, the 



density is comparatively low. Upon melting, this 
structure is partially destroyed, such that the 
water molecules become more closely packed to¬ 
gether (Figure 2.16b) — at room temperature the 
average number of nearest-neighbor water mol¬ 
ecules has increased to approximately 4.5; this 
leads to an increase in density. 

Consequences of this anomalous freezing 
phenomenon are familiar. This phenomenon ex¬ 
plains why icebergs float; why, in cold climates, it 
is necessary to add antifreeze to an automobile’s 
cooling system (to keep the engine block from 
cracking); and why freeze-thaw cycles break up 
the pavement in streets and cause potholes to 
form.

2.8 MOLECULES 

Many of the common molecules are composed of groups of atoms that are bound 
together by strong covalent bonds; these include elemental diatomic molecules 
(F 2 , 0 2 , H 2 , etc.) as well as a host of compounds (H 2 0, C0 2 , HN0 3 , C 6 H 6 , CH 4 , 
etc.). In the condensed liquid and solid states, bonds between molecules are weak 
secondary ones. Consequently, molecular materials have relatively low melting 
and boiling temperatures. Most of those that have small molecules composed of 
a few atoms are gases at ordinary, or ambient, temperatures and pressures. On 
the other hand, many of the modern polymers, being molecular materials com¬ 
posed of extremely large molecules, exist as solids; some of their properties are 
strongly dependent on the presence of van der Waals and hydrogen secondary 
bonds. 


SUMMARY 


Electrons in Atoms 

• The two atomic models are Bohr and wave-mechanical. Whereas the Bohr model 
assumes electrons to be particles orbiting the nucleus in discrete paths, in wave 
mechanics we consider them to be wavelike and treat electron position in terms 
of a probability distribution. 

• The energies of electrons are quantized—that is, only specific values of energy 
are allowed. 

• The four electron quantum numbers are n, /, m h and m s . Each of these specifies 
a distinct electron characteristic. 

• According to the Pauli exclusion principle, each electron state can accommodate 
no more than two electrons, which must have opposite spins. 


The Periodic Table 

• Elements in each of the columns (or groups) of the periodic table have distinc¬ 
tive electron configurations. For example, 

Group 0 elements (the inert gases) have filled electron shells, and Group 
IA elements (the alkali metals) have one electron greater than a filled 
electron shell. 


Bonding Forces and Energies 

• Bonding force and bonding energy are related to one another according to Equa¬ 
tion 2.4. 

• Attractive, repulsive, and net energies for two atoms or ions depend on inter¬ 
atomic separation per the schematic plot of Figure 2.8 b. 

• From a plot of interatomic separation versus force for two atoms/ions, the equi¬ 
librium separation corresponds to the value at zero force. 

• From a plot of interatomic separation versus potential energy for two 
atoms/ions, the bonding energy corresponds to the energy value at the mini¬ 
mum of the curve.

Primary Interatomic Bonds 

• For ionic bonds, electrically charged ions are formed by the transference of va¬ 
lence electrons from one atom type to another. This type of bonding is found in 
ceramic materials. 

• There is a sharing of valence electrons between adjacent atoms when bonding is 
covalent. Polymers and some ceramic materials covalently bond. 

• The percent ionic character (%IC) of a bond between two elements (A and B) 
depends on their electronegativities (A’s) according to Equation 2.10. 

• With metallic bonding, the valence electrons form a “sea of electrons” that is uni¬ 
formly dispersed around the metal ion cores and acts as a form of glue for them. 
Metallic materials exhibit this type of bonding. 


Secondary Bonding or van der Waals Bonding 

• Relatively weak van der Waals bonds result from attractive forces between elec¬ 
tric dipoles, which may be induced or permanent. 

• For hydrogen bonding, highly polar molecules form when hydrogen covalently 
bonds to a nonmetallic element such as fluorine.

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

In this chapter, we noted that the electron configuration of an atom influences the 
type of bonds that it forms with other atoms. Bonding type also affects other struc¬ 
tural elements of the material: for silicon, its electron band structure (Chapter 18); 
for polymeric materials (i.e., fibers), their molecular structures (Chapter 14). These 
relationships are represented in the following diagrams.

WHY STUDY The Structure of Crystalline Solids? 


The properties of some materials are directly related to 
their crystal structures. For example, pure and unde¬ 
formed magnesium and beryllium, having one crystal 
structure, are much more brittle (i.e., fracture at lower 
degrees of deformation) than are pure and undeformed 
metals such as gold and silver that have yet another 
crystal structure (see Section 7.4). 

Furthermore, significant property differences exist 
between crystalline and noncrystalline materials having 
the same composition. For example, noncrystalline ce¬ 
ramics and polymers normally are optically transparent; 
the same materials in crystalline (or semicrystalline) 
form tend to be opaque or, at best, translucent. 


In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying the structure of crystalline 
solids are as follows: 

• A knowledge of the crystal structure for iron helps us 
understand transformations that occur when steels are 
heat treated to improve their mechanical properties 
(Chapter 10). (iron is the major constituent of steels.) 

• The production of a glass-ceramic (Chapters 12 and 
13) involves the formation of a glass that is subse¬ 
quently transformed into a crystalline solid. This 
chapter also discusses briefly the structure (on an 
atomic level) of materials that are noncrystalline 
(i.e., that form glasses). 


Learning Objectives 


After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe the difference in atomic/molecular 
structure between crystalline and noncrys¬ 
talline materials. 

2. Draw unit cells for face-centered cubic, body- 
centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed 
crystal structures. 

3. Derive the relationships between unit cell edge 
length and atomic radius for face-centered cu¬ 
bic and body-centered cubic crystal structures. 

4. Compute the densities for metals having face- 

centered cubic and body-centered cubic crys¬ 
tal structures given their unit cell dimensions. 


5. Given three direction index integers, sketch 
the direction corresponding to these indices 
within a unit cell. 

6. Specify the Miller indices for a plane that has 
been drawn within a unit cell.

close-packed crystal structures may be generated 
by the stacking of close-packed planes of atoms. 

8. Distinguish between single crystals and poly¬ 
crystalline materials. 

9. Define isotropy and anisotropy with respect to 
material properties. 


3.1 INTRODUCTION 

Chapter 2 was concerned primarily with the various types of atomic bonding, which 
are determined by the electron structures of the individual atoms. The present dis¬ 
cussion is devoted to the next level of the structure of materials, specifically, to some 
of the arrangements that may be assumed by atoms in the solid state. Within this 
framework, concepts of crystallinity and noncrystallinity are introduced. For crys¬ 
talline solids the notion of crystal structure is presented, specified in terms of a unit 
cell. The three common crystal structures found in metals are then detailed, along 
with the scheme by which crystallographic points, directions, and planes are expressed. 
Single crystals, polycrystalline materials, and noncrystalline materials are consid¬ 
ered. Another section of this chapter briefly describes how crystal structures are 
determined experimentally using x-ray diffraction techniques.

Crystal Structures— - 

3.2 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 

Solid materials may be classified according to the regularity with which atoms or ions 
crystalline are arranged with respect to one another. A crystalline material is one in which the 

atoms are situated in a repeating or periodic array over large atomic distances; that 
is, long-range order exists, such that upon solidification, the atoms will position them¬ 
selves in a repetitive three-dimensional pattern, in which each atom is bonded to its 
nearest-neighbor atoms. All metals, many ceramic materials, and certain polymers 
form crystalline structures under normal solidification conditions. For those that do 
not crystallize, this long-range atomic order is absent; these noncrystalline or amor¬ 
phous materials are discussed briefly at the end of this chapter, 
crystal structure Some of the properties of crystalline solids depend on the crystal structure of 

the material, the manner in which atoms, ions, or molecules are spatially arranged. 
There is an extremely large number of different crystal structures all having long-range 
atomic order; these vary from relatively simple structures for metals to exceedingly 
complex ones, as displayed by some of the ceramic and polymeric materials. The pres¬ 
ent discussion deals with several common metallic crystal structures. Chapters 12 and 
14 are devoted to crystal structures for ceramics and polymers, respectively. 

When describing crystalline structures, atoms (or ions) are thought of as being 
solid spheres having well-defined diameters. This is termed the atomic hard-sphere

centered cubic crystal

model in which spheres representing nearest-neighbor atoms touch one another. 
An example of the hard-sphere model for the atomic arrangement found in some 
of the common elemental metals is displayed in Figure 3.1c. In this particular case 
lattice all the atoms are identical. Sometimes the term lattice is used in the context of crys¬ 

tal structures; in this sense lattice means a three-dimensional array of points coin¬ 
ciding with atom positions (or sphere centers). 

CELLS 

The atomic order in crystalline solids indicates that small groups of atoms form a 
repetitive pattern. Thus, in describing crystal structures, it is often convenient to sub¬ 
divide the structure into small repeat entities called unit cells. Unit cells for most crys¬ 
tal structures are parallelepipeds or prisms having three sets of parallel faces; one is 
drawn within the aggregate of spheres (Figure 3.1c), which in this case happens to be 
a cube. A unit cell is chosen to represent the symmetry of the crystal structure, wherein 
all the atom positions in the crystal may be generated by translations of the unit cell 
integral distances along each of its edges. Thus, the unit cell is the basic structural unit 
or building block of the crystal structure and defines the crystal structure by virtue 
of its geometry and the atom positions within. Convenience usually dictates that par¬ 
allelepiped corners coincide with centers of the hard-sphere atoms. Furthermore, more 
than a single unit cell may be chosen for a particular crystal structure; however, we 
generally use the unit cell having the highest level of geometrical symmetry. 

3.4 METALLIC CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 

The atomic bonding in this group of materials is metallic and thus nondirectional 
in nature. Consequently, there are minimal restrictions as to the number and posi¬ 
tion of nearest-neighbor atoms; this leads to relatively large numbers of nearest 
neighbors and dense atomic packings for most metallic crystal structures. Also, for 
metals, using the hard-sphere model for the crystal structure, each sphere repre¬ 
sents an ion core. Table 3.1 presents the atomic radii for a number of metals. Three 
relatively simple crystal structures are found for most of the common metals: face- 
centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close-packed. 

The Face-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure 

The crystal structure found for many metals has a unit cell of cubic geometry, with 
atoms located at each of the corners and the centers of all the cube faces. It is aptly

The Structure of Crystalline Solids 


called the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. Some of the familiar metals hav¬ 
ing this crystal structure are copper, aluminum, silver, and gold (see also Table 3.1). 
Figure 3.1 a shows a hard-sphere model for the FCC unit cell, whereas in Figure 3.1 b 
the atom centers are represented by small circles to provide a better perspective of 
atom positions. The aggregate of atoms in Figure 3.1c represents a section of crystal 
consisting of many FCC unit cells. These spheres or ion cores touch one another across 
a face diagonal; the cube edge length a and the atomic radius R are related through 

a = 2RV2. (3.1) 

This result is obtained in Example Problem 3.1. 

For the FCC crystal structure, each corner atom is shared among eight unit cells, 
whereas a face-centered atom belongs to only two. Therefore, one-eighth of each 
of the eight corner atoms and one-half of each of the six face atoms, or a total of 
four whole atoms, may be assigned to a given unit cell. This is depicted in Figure 3.1 a, 
where only sphere portions are represented within the confines of the cube. The 
cell comprises the volume of the cube, which is generated from the centers of the 
corner atoms as shown in the figure. 

Corner and face positions are really equivalent; that is, translation of the cube 
corner from an original corner atom to the center of a face atom will not alter the 
cell structure. 

Two other important characteristics of a crystal structure are the coordination 
number and the atomic packing factor (APF). For metals, each atom has the same 
number of nearest-neighbor or touching atoms, which is the coordination number. 
For face-centered cubics, the coordination number is 12. This may be confirmed by 
examination of Figure 3.1 a; the front face atom has four corner nearest-neighbor 
atoms surrounding it, four face atoms that are in contact from behind, and four other 
equivalent face atoms residing in the next unit cell to the front, which is not shown. 

The APF is the sum of the sphere volumes of all atoms within a unit cell (as¬ 
suming the atomic hard-sphere model) divided by the unit cell volume—that is, 

A volume of atoms in a unit cell 

APF = -;-;--—t- (3.2) 

total unit cell volume 


For the FCC structure, the atomic packing factor is 0.74, which is the maximum 
packing possible for spheres all having the same diameter. Computation of this APF 
is also included as an example problem. Metals typically have relatively large atomic 
packing factors to maximize the shielding provided by the free electron cloud. 

The Body-Centered Cubic Crystal Structure 

Another common metallic crystal structure also has a cubic unit cell with atoms 
located at all eight corners and a single atom at the cube center. This is called a 
body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. A collection of spheres depicting this 
crystal structure is shown in Figure 3.2c, whereas Figures 3.2 a and 3.2 b are diagrams 
of BCC unit cells with the atoms represented by hard-sphere and reduced-sphere 
models, respectively. Center and corner atoms touch one another along cube diag¬ 
onals, and unit cell length a and atomic radius R are related through

Two atoms are associated with each BCC unit cell: the equivalent of one atom 
from the eight corners, each of which is shared among eight unit cells, and the sin¬ 
gle center atom, which is wholly contained within its cell. In addition, corner and 
center atom positions are equivalent. The coordination number for the BCC crys¬ 
tal structure is 8; each center atom has as nearest neighbors its eight corner atoms. 
Because the coordination number is less for BCC than FCC, so also is the atomic 
packing factor for BCC lower—0.68 versus 0.74. 

The Hexagonal Close-Packed Crystal Structure 

Not all metals have unit cells with cubic symmetry; the final common metallic crystal 
structure to be discussed has a unit cell that is hexagonal. Figure 3.3a shows a reduced- 
sphere unit cell for this structure, which is termed hexagonal close-packed (HCP); an

assemblage of several HCP unit cells is presented in Figure 3.3 b. 1 The top and bottom 
faces of the unit cell consist of six atoms that form regular hexagons and surround a 
single atom in the center. Another plane that provides three additional atoms to the 
unit cell is situated between the top and bottom planes. The atoms in this midplane 
have as nearest neighbors atoms in both of the adjacent two planes. The equivalent of 
six atoms is contained in each unit cell; one-sixth of each of the 12 top and bottom 
face corner atoms, one-half of each of the 2 center face atoms, and all 3 midplane in¬ 
terior atoms. If a and c represent, respectively, the short and long unit cell dimensions 
of Figure 3.3a, the c/a ratio should be 1.633; however, for some HCP metals this ratio 
deviates from the ideal value. 

The coordination number and the atomic packing factor for the HCP crystal struc¬ 
ture are the same as for FCC: 12 and 0.74, respectively. The HCP metals include cad¬ 
mium, magnesium, titanium, and zinc; some of these are listed in Table 3.1. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.1 

Determination of FCC Unit Cell Volume 

Calculate the volume of an FCC unit cell in terms of the atomic radius R. 

Solution 

In the FCC unit cell illustrated, 



the atoms touch one another across a face-diagonal the length of which is 4 R. 
Because the unit cell is a cube, its volume is a 3 , where a is the cell edge length. 
From the right triangle on the face, 

a 2 + a 2 = (4 R) 2 


or, solving for a, 


a = 2RV2. 

The FCC unit cell volume V c may be computed from 

V c = a 3 = {2RV2) 3 = 16R 3 V2

1 Alternatively, the unit cell for HCP may be specified in terms of the parallelepiped defined 

by the atoms labeled A through H in Figure 3.3 a. Thus, the atom denoted J lies within the 

unit cell interior.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.2 


Computation of the Atomic Packing Factor for FCC 

Show that the atomic packing factor for the FCC crystal structure is 0.74. 

Solution 

The APF is defined as the fraction of solid sphere volume in a unit cell, or 

_ volume of atoms in a unit cell _ V s 
total unit cell volume V c 


Both the total atom and unit cell volumes may be calculated in terms of the 
atomic radius R. The volume for a sphere is p tR 3 , and because there are four 
atoms per FCC unit cell, the total FCC atom (or sphere) volume is 

V s = (4)|t tR 3 = f, tR 3 


From Example Problem 3.1, the total unit cell volume is 

V c = 16R 3 V2

Theoretical Density Computation for Copper 

Copper has an atomic radius of 0.128 nm, an FCC crystal structure, and an 
atomic weight of 63.5 g/mol. Compute its theoretical density and compare the 
answer with its measured density. 

Solution 

Equation 3.5 is employed in the solution of this problem. Because the crystal 
structure is FCC, n, the number of atoms per unit cell, is 4. Furthermore, the 
atomic weight A Cu is given as 63.5 g/mol. The unit cell volume V c for FCC 
was determined in Example Problem 3.1 as 16i? 3 V2, where R , the atomic 
radius, is 0.128 nm.

close agreement with the foregoing result. 


3.6 POLYMORPHISM AND ALLOTROPY 


polymorphism 

allotropy 


Some metals, as well as nonmetals, may have more than one crystal structure, a phe¬ 
nomenon known as polymorphism. When found in elemental solids, the condition is 
often termed allotropy. The prevailing crystal structure depends on both the temper¬ 
ature and the external pressure. One familiar example is found in carbon: graphite is 
the stable polymorph at ambient conditions, whereas diamond is formed at extremely 
high pressures. Also, pure iron has a BCC crystal structure at room temperature, which 
changes to FCC iron at 912°C (1674°F). Most often a modification of the density and 
other physical properties accompanies a polymorphic transformation.

Crystal Systems and 
Unit Cells for Metals 


lattice parameters 
crystal system 


Because there are many different possible crystal structures, it is sometimes conven¬ 
ient to divide them into groups according to unit cell configurations and/or atomic 
arrangements. One such scheme is based on the unit cell geometry, that is, the shape 
of the appropriate unit cell parallelepiped without regard to the atomic positions in 
the cell. Within this framework, an xyz coordinate system is established with its origin 
at one of the unit cell corners; each of the x, y, and z axes coincides with one of the 
three parallelepiped edges that extend from this corner, as illustrated in Figure 3.4. 
The unit cell geometry is completely defined in terms of six parameters: the three edge 
lengths a , b , and c, and the three interaxial angles a , /3, and y. These are indicated in 
Figure 3.4, and are sometimes termed the lattice parameters of a crystal structure. 

On this basis there are seven different possible combinations of a , b, and c, and 
a , /3, and y, each of which represents a distinct crystal system. These seven crystal 
systems are cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, 2 monoclinic, 
and triclinic. The lattice parameter relationships and unit cell sketches for each are

MATERIAL OF IMPORTANCE 

Tin (its Allotropic Transformation) 


A nother common metal that experiences an al¬ 
lotropic change is tin. White (or /3) tin, hav¬ 
ing a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure at 
room temperature, transforms, at 13.2°C (55.8°F), 


to gray (or a) tin, which has a crystal structure sim¬ 
ilar to diamond (i.e., the diamond cubic crystal 
structure); this transformation is represented 
schematically as follows: 



13.2°C 

Cooling 



The rate at which this change takes place is extremely 
slow; however, the lower the temperature (below 
13.2°C) the faster the rate. Accompanying this white- 
to-gray-tin transformation is an increase in volume 
(27%), and, accordingly, a decrease in density (from 
7.30 g/cm 3 to 5.77 g/cm 3 ). Consequently, this volume 
expansion results in the disintegration of the white 
tin metal into a coarse powder of the gray allotrope. 
For normal subambient temperatures, there is no 
need to worry about this disintegration process for 
tin products, because of the very slow rate at which 
the transformation occurs. 

This white-to-gray-tin transition produced 
some rather dramatic results in 1850 in Russia. The 
winter that year was particularly cold, and record 
low temperatures persisted for extended periods 
of time. The uniforms of some Russian soldiers had 
tin buttons, many of which crumbled because of 
these extreme cold conditions, as did also many of 
the tin church organ pipes. This problem came to 
be known as the “tin disease.”

represented in Table 3.2. The cubic system, for which a = b = c and a = (3 = y = 
90°, has the greatest degree of symmetry. The least symmetry is displayed by the tri¬ 
clinic system, because a ^ b =/= c and a ± (3 =£ y. 

From the discussion of metallic crystal structures, it should be apparent that 
both FCC and BCC structures belong to the cubic crystal system, whereas HCP 
falls within hexagonal. The conventional hexagonal unit cell really consists of three 
parallelepipeds situated as shown in Table 3.2.

3.8 Point Coordinates * 55 




Concept Check 3.1 

What is the difference between crystal structure and crystal system? 

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).\ 


It is important to note that many of the principles and concepts addressed 
in previous discussions in this chapter also apply to crystalline ceramic and poly¬ 
meric systems (Chapters 12 and 14). For example, crystal structures are most of¬ 
ten described in terms of unit cells, which are normally more complex than those 
for FCC, BCC, and HCP. In addition, for these other systems, we are often in¬ 
terested in determining atomic packing factors and densities, using modified 
forms of Equations 3.2 and 3.5. Furthermore, according to unit cell geometry, 
crystal structures of these other material types are grouped within the seven crys¬ 
tal systems. 

Crystallographic Points, 

Directions, and Planes 


When dealing with crystalline materials, it often becomes necessary to specify a par¬ 
ticular point within a unit cell, a crystallographic direction, or some crystallographic 
plane of atoms. Labeling conventions have been established in which three num¬ 
bers or indices are used to designate point locations, directions, and planes. The basis 
for determining index values is the unit cell, with a right-handed coordinate system 
consisting of three (x, y, and z) axes situated at one of the corners and coinciding 
with the unit cell edges, as shown in Figure 3.4. For some crystal systems—namely, 
hexagonal, rhombohedral, monoclinic, and triclinic—the three axes are not mutu¬ 
ally perpendicular, as in the familiar Cartesian coordinate scheme. 

3.8 POINT COORDINATES 

The position of any point located within a unit cell may be specified in terms of its 
coordinates as fractional multiples of the unit cell edge lengths (i.e., in terms of a , b , 
and c ). To illustrate, consider the unit cell and the point P situated therein as shown 
in Figure 3.5. We specify the position of P in terms of the generalized coordinates 



Figure 3.5 The manner in which the q , r, 
and ^ coordinates at point P within the 
unit cell are determined. The q coordinate 
(which is a fraction) corresponds to the 
distance qa along the x axis, where a is 
the unit cell edge length. The respective 
r and s coordinates for the y and z axes 
are determined similarly. 















56 * Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 

q , r, and s where q is some fractional length of a along the x axis, r is some fractional 
length of b along the y axis, and similarly for Thus, the position of P is designated 
using coordinates q r s with values that are less than or equal to unity. Furthermore, 
we have chosen not to separate these coordinates by commas or any other punctu¬ 
ation marks (which is the normal convention). 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3,4 

Location of Point Having Specified Coordinates 

For the unit cell shown in the accompanying sketch ( a ), locate the point hav¬ 
ing coordinates \ i\. 



Solution 

From sketch ( a ), edge lengths for this unit cell are as follows: a = 0.48 nm, 
b = 0.46 nm, and c = 0.40 nm. Furthermore, in light of the preceding discussion, 
fractional lengths are q = |, r = 1, and s = Therefore, first we move from 
the origin of the unit cell (point M) qa = \ (0.48 nm) = 0.12 nm units along 
the x axis (to point N), as shown in the ( b ) sketch. Similarly, we proceed 
rb = (1)(0.46 nm) = 0.46 nm parallel to the y axis, from point N to point O. 
Finally, we move from this position, sc = \ (0.40 nm) = 0.20 nm units parallel 
to the z axis to point P as noted again in sketch (b). This point P then corre¬ 
sponds to the \ l\ point coordinates. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.5 


Specification of Point Coordinates 

Specify point coordinates for all atom positions for a BCC unit cell. 

Solution 

For the BCC unit cell of Figure 3.2, atom position coordinates correspond to 
the locations of the centers of all atoms in the unit cell—that is, the eight cor¬ 
ner atoms and single center atom. These positions are noted (and also num¬ 
bered) in the following figure. 




















3.9 Crystallographic Directions * 57 


3.9 



Point coordinates for position number 1 are 0 0 0; this position is located 
at the origin of the coordinate system, and, therefore, the fractional unit cell 
edge lengths along the x, y, and z axes are, respectively, 0 a, 0 a, and 0 a. Fur¬ 
thermore, for position number 2, because it lies one unit cell edge length along 
the x axis, its fractional edge lengths are a , 0a , and 0 a, respectively, which yield 
point coordinates of 1 0 0. The following table presents fractional unit cell 
lengths along the x, y, and z axes, and their corresponding point coordinates 
for each of the nine points in the preceding figure.

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DIRECTIONS 


VMSE 



Crystallographic 

Directions 


A crystallographic direction is defined as a line between two points, or a vector. 

The following steps are used to determine the three directional indices: 

1. A vector of convenient length is positioned such that it passes through the 
origin of the coordinate system. Any vector may be translated throughout the 
crystal lattice without alteration, if parallelism is maintained. 

2. The length of the vector projection on each of the three axes is determined; 
these are measured in terms of the unit cell dimensions a , b , and c. 

3. These three numbers are multiplied or divided by a common factor to reduce 
them to the smallest integer values. 

4. The three indices, not separated by commas, are enclosed in square brackets, 
thus: [uvw]. The u , v, and w integers correspond to the reduced projections 
along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.

r 


X 


For each of the three axes, there will exist both positive and negative coordi¬ 
nates. Thus negative indices are also possible, which are represented by a bar over 
the appropriate index. For example, the [111] direction would have a component 
in the —y direction. Also, changing the signs of all indices produces an antiparallel 
direction; that is, [III] is directly opposite to [111]. If more than one direction (or 
plane) is to be specified for a particular crystal structure, it is imperative for the 
maintaining of consistency that a positive-negative convention, once established, 
not be changed. 

The [100], [110], and [111] directions are common ones; they are drawn in the 
unit cell shown in Figure 3.6.

Solution 

The vector, as drawn, passes through the origin of the coordinate system, and 
therefore no translation is necessary. Projections of this vector onto the x, y, 
and z axes are, respectively, a/ 2, b, and 0c, which become 1, and 0 in terms 
of the unit cell parameters (i.e., when the a , b , and c are dropped). Reduction 
of these numbers to the lowest set of integers is accompanied by multiplica¬ 
tion of each by the factor 2. This yields the integers 1,2, and 0, which are then 
enclosed in brackets as [120].

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.7 

Construction of Specified Crystallographic Direction 

Draw a [1T0] direction within a cubic unit cell. 

Solution 

First construct an appropriate unit cell and coordinate axes system. In the 
accompanying figure the unit cell is cubic, and the origin of the coordinate 
system, point O, is located at one of the cube corners. 


z 



This problem is solved by reversing the procedure of the preceding example. 
For this [llO] direction, the projections along the x, y, and z axes are a , - a , 
and (k, respectively. This direction is defined by a vector passing from the ori¬ 
gin to point P, which is located by first moving along the x axis a units, and 
from this position, parallel to the y axis -a units, as indicated in the figure. 
There is no z component to the vector, because the z projection is zero. 


For some crystal structures, several nonparallel directions with different indices 
are crystallographically equivalent; this means that the spacing of atoms along each 
direction is the same. For example, in cubic crystals, all the directions represented 
by the following indices are equivalent: [100], [TOO], [010], [0T0], [001], and [001]. As 
a convenience, equivalent directions are grouped together into a family , which are 
enclosed in angle brackets, thus: (100). Furthermore, directions in cubic crystals having 
the same indices without regard to order or sign—for example, [123] and [213] — 
are equivalent. This is, in general, not true for other crystal systems. For example, 
for crystals of tetragonal symmetry, [100] and [010] directions are equivalent, 
whereas [100] and [001] are not.

Figure 3.7 Coordinate axis system for a hexagonal unit cell 
(Miller-Bravais scheme). 


Hexagonal Crystals 

A problem arises for crystals having hexagonal symmetry in that some crystallo¬ 
graphic equivalent directions will not have the same set of indices. This is circum¬ 
vented by utilizing a four-axis, or Miller-Bravais, coordinate system as shown in Fig¬ 
ure 3.7. The three a x , a 2 , and a 3 axes are all contained within a single plane (called 
the basal plane) and are at 120° angles to one another. The z axis is perpendicular 
to this basal plane. Directional indices, which are obtained as described earlier, will 
be denoted by four indices, as [uvtw]; by convention, the first three indices pertain 
to projections along the respective a x , a 2 , and a 3 axes in the basal plane. 
Conversion from the three-index system to the four-index system, 

\u'v'w'] -> [uvtw] 

is accomplished by the following formulas: 


u = — (2 u' — v’) 

V = f (2v' - u') 

t = — (u + t>) 
w = w'

where primed indices are associated with the three-index scheme and unprimed with 
the new Miller-Bravais four-index system. (Of course, reduction to the lowest set of in¬ 
tegers may be necessary, as discussed earlier.) For example, the [010] direction becomes 
[T2T0]. Several different directions are indicated in the hexagonal unit cell (Figure 3.8a).

Figure 3.9 Reduced-scale coordinate axis 
system for hexagonal unit cells that may be 
used to plot crystallographic directions. 


The plotting of crystallographic directions for hexagonal crystals is more 
complicated than for crystals belonging to the other six systems. For hexagonal 
it is sometimes more convenient to use the four-axis coordinate system shown in 
Figure 3.9. As may be noted, a grid has been constructed on the basal plane that 
consists of sets of lines parallel to each of the a 1? a 2 , and a 3 axes. The intersections 
of two sets of parallel lines (e.g., those for a 2 , and a 3 ) lie on and trisect the other 
axis (e.g., divide a x into thirds) within the hexagonal unit cell. In addition, the z axis 
of Figure 3.9 is also apportioned into three equal lengths (at trisection points m 
and n). We will refer to this scheme as a reduced-scale coordinate system. 

Construction of a direction specified by four indices is carried out using a pro¬ 
cedure similar to that described previously (which involves vector projections along 
corresponding axes). In this case, rather than taking projections in terms of the lat¬ 
tice parameters a (for a 3 , a 2 , and %,) and c (for the z axis), we employ the reduced- 
scale scheme of Figure 3.9—i.e., use | and | instead. This procedure is illustrated 
in the following example problem. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.8 

Conversion and Construction of Directional Indices for a 

Hexagonal Unit Cell 

(a) Convert the [111] direction into the four-index system for hexagonal crystals. 

(b) Draw this direction within a reduced-scale coordinate system (per Fig¬ 
ure 3.9). 

(c) Now draw the [111] direction within a hexagonal unit cell that utilizes a 
three-axis (a l5 a 2 , z) coordinate system. 

Solution 

(a) This conversion is carried out using Equations 3.6a, 3.6b, 3.6c, and 3.6d, 
in which 


u' = 1 v' = 1 w' = 1 





















62 


Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 


Thus, 


u 

v

w 


|(2m' - V ') = | [(2)(1) - 1] = | 
|(2t,'-«') = |[(2)(l)-l]=| 

-(«+«) =-(!+!) = - 1 
w' = 1 


Multiplication of the preceding indices by 3 reduces them to the lowest 
set, which yields values for u , v, t , and w of 1, 1, -2 and 3, respectively. 
Hence, the [111] direction becomes [1123]. 

(b) The following sketch ( a ) shows a hexagonal unit cell in which the reduced- 
scale coordinate system has been drawn. 



Also, one of the three parallelepipeds comprising the hexagonal cell is 
delineated—its corners are labeled with letters o-A-r-B-C-D-E-s , with the 
origin of the a r a 2 -a 3 -z axes coordinate system located at the corner labeled 
o. It is within this unit cell that we draw the [1123] direction. The projec¬ 
tions along the a l9 a 2 , a 3 , and z axes are, respectively |, |, -y, and y (or 
c). In constructing this direction vector we begin at the origin (point o), and 
first proceed | units along the a x axis to point p, next from this point par¬ 
allel to the a 2 axis | units to point q , then parallel to the a 3 axis -y units 
to point r, and finally we continue parallel to the z axis c units to point s. 
Thus, [1123] is represented by the vector that is directed from point o to 
point s, as noted in the sketch. 

(c) Of course, it is possible to draw the equivalent [111] direction using a 
three-coordinate-axis ( a r a 2 -z ) system and the conventional technique. 
This is represented in sketch ( b ). In this case, projections on the a 3 , a 2 , and 
































3.10 Crystallographic Planes * 63 


z axes are a , a , and c, respectively. First we begin at the origin (point O ), 
then proceed a units along the a x axis (to point P), next parallel to the a 2 
axis a units (to point Q ), and finally parallel to the z axis c units (to point 
R ). Hence, the [111] direction is represented by the vector that passes from 
O to R as shown. 

It may be noted that this [111] direction is identical to [1123] from part (b). 


The alternative situation is to determine the indices for a direction that has been 
drawn within a hexagonal unit cell. For this case it is convenient to use the a r a 2 -z 
three-coordinate-axis system and then convert these indices into the equivalent set for 
the four-axis scheme. The following example problem demonstrates this procedure.

The first thing we need do is to determine indices for the vector referenced 
to the three-axis scheme represented in the sketch. Because the direction vec¬ 
tor passes through the origin of the coordinate system, no translation is nec¬ 
essary. Projections of this vector onto the a x , a 2 , and z axes are Oa, -a , and c/2, 
respectively, which become 0,-1, and \ in terms of the unit cell parame¬ 
ters. Reduction of these numbers to the lowest set of integers is possible by 
multiplying each by the factor 2. This yields 0, -2, and 1, which are then en¬ 
closed in brackets as [021].

Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 


Now it becomes necessary to convert these indices into an index set ref¬ 
erenced to the four-axis scheme. This requires the use of Equations 3.6a, 3.6b, 
3.6c, and 3.6d. For this [021] direction 

u f = 0 v' — 2 w' = 1 

and 

u = |(2 u' - V') = |[(2)(0) - (-2)] = | 

» = f(2v' ~ W) = |[(2)(-2) -<>]=■ 

, , (2 4\ 2 

w = w' = 1 

Multiplication of the preceding indices by 3 reduces them to the lowest set, 
which yields values for u , v, t , and w of 2, -4,2, and 3, respectively. Hence, the 
direction vector shown in the figure is [2423]. 


3.10 CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC PLANES 


The orientations of planes for a crystal structure are represented in a similar man¬ 
ner. Again, the unit cell is the basis, with the three-axis coordinate system as rep¬ 
resented in Figure 3.4. In all but the hexagonal crystal system, crystallographic planes 
Miller indices are specified by three Miller indices as (hkl). Any two planes parallel to each other 

are equivalent and have identical indices. The procedure used to determine the h, 
k, and / index numbers is as follows: 


VMSE 



Crystallographic 

Planes 


1. If the plane passes through the selected origin, either another parallel plane 
must be constructed within the unit cell by an appropriate translation, or a 
new origin must be established at the corner of another unit cell. 

2. At this point the crystallographic plane either intersects or parallels each of 
the three axes; the length of the planar intercept for each axis is determined 
in terms of the lattice parameters a , b , and c. 

3. The reciprocals of these numbers are taken. A plane that parallels an axis 
may be considered to have an infinite intercept, and, therefore, a zero index. 

4. If necessary, these three numbers are changed to the set of smallest integers 
by multiplication or division by a common factor. 3 

5. Finally, the integer indices, not separated by commas, are enclosed within 
parentheses, thus: (hkl). 


An intercept on the negative side of the origin is indicated by a bar or minus 
sign positioned over the appropriate index. Furthermore, reversing the directions 
of all indices specifies another plane parallel to, on the opposite side of, and equi¬ 
distant from the origin. Several low-index planes are represented in Figure 3.10. 


3 On occasion, index reduction is not carried out (e.g., for x-ray diffraction studies that are 
described in Section 3.16); for example, (002) is not reduced to (001). In addition, for 
ceramic materials, the ionic arrangement for a reduced-index plane may be different from 
that for a nonreduced one.

One interesting and unique characteristic of cubic crystals is that planes and 
directions having the same indices are perpendicular to one another; however, for 
other crystal systems there are no simple geometrical relationships between planes 
and directions having the same indices. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.10 











































66 * Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 


Solution 

Because the plane passes through the selected origin O, a new origin must be 
chosen at the corner of an adjacent unit cell, taken as O' and shown in sketch 
(b). This plane is parallel to the % axis, and the intercept may be taken as oo a. The 
y and z axes’ intersections, referenced to the new origin O', are —b and c/2, 
respectively. Thus, in terms of the lattice parameters a, b , and c, these inter¬ 
sections are oo, -1, and \. The reciprocals of these numbers are 0,-1, and 2; 
because all are integers, no further reduction is necessary. Finally, enclosure 
in parentheses yields (0T2). 

These steps are briefly summarized here:

Solution 

To solve this problem, carry out the procedure used in the preceding exam¬ 
ple in reverse order. To begin, the indices are removed from the parentheses, 
and reciprocals are taken, which yields oo, — 1, and 1. This means that the par¬ 
ticular plane parallels the x axis while intersecting the y and z axes at —b and 
c, respectively, as indicated in the accompanying sketch (a). This plane has been 
drawn in sketch (6). A plane is indicated by lines representing its intersections 
with the planes that constitute the faces of the unit cell or their extensions. 
For example, in this figure, line ef is the intersection between the (Oil) plane 
and the top face of the unit cell; also, line gh represents the intersection be¬ 
tween this same (Oil) plane and the plane of the bottom unit cell face 
extended. Similarly, lines eg and fh are the intersections between (Oil) and 
back and front cell faces, respectively.

Planar Atomic 
Arrangements 


Atomic Arrangements 

The atomic arrangement for a crystallographic plane, which is often of interest, de¬ 
pends on the crystal structure. The (110) atomic planes for FCC and BCC crystal 
structures are represented in Figures 3.11 and 3.12; reduced-sphere unit cells are 
also included. Note that the atomic packing is different for each case. The circles 
represent atoms lying in the crystallographic planes as would be obtained from a 
slice taken through the centers of the full-sized hard spheres. 

A “family” of planes contains all planes that are crystallographically equivalent— 
that is, having the same atomic packing; a family is designated by indices that are en¬ 
closed in braces—such as {100}. For example,in cubic crystals the (111), (Til), (Til), 
(ITT), (11T), (TTl), (TlT), and (lTl) planes all belong to the {111} family. On the 
other hand, for tetragonal crystal structures, the {100} family would contain only the 
(100), (TOO), (010), and (0T0) because the (001) and (00T) planes are not crystallo¬ 
graphically equivalent. Also, in the cubic system only, planes having the same indices, 
irrespective of order and sign, are equivalent. For example, both (123) and (3T2) be¬ 
long to the {123} family. 

Hexagonal Crystals 

For crystals having hexagonal symmetry, it is desirable that equivalent planes have 
the same indices; as with directions, this is accomplished by the Miller-Bravais sys¬ 
tem shown in Figure 3.7. This convention leads to the four-index (hkil) scheme, 
which is favored in most instances because it more clearly identifies the orientation 
of a plane in a hexagonal crystal. There is some redundancy in that i is determined 
by the sum of h and k through 


(3.7) 


(h + k ) 


i = 


Otherwise the three h, k, and / indices are identical for both indexing systems. 
Figure 3.86 presents several of the common planes that are found for crystals hav¬ 
ing hexagonal symmetry.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.12 

Determination of Miller-Bravais Indices for a Plane 
within a Hexagonal Unit Cell 

Determine the Miller-Bravais indices for the plane shown in the hexagonal 
unit cell. 


z 



Solution 

To determine these Miller-Bravais indices, consider the plane in the figure 
referenced to the parallelepiped labeled with the letters A through H at its 
corners. This plane intersects the a x axis at a distance a from the origin of the 
a r a 2 -a 3 -z coordinate axis system (point C). Furthermore, its intersections with 
the a 2 and z axes are -a and c, respectively. Therefore, in terms of the lattice 
parameters, these intersections are 1,-1, and 1. Furthermore, the reciprocals 
of these numbers are also 1,-1, and 1. Hence 

h = 1 
k — — 1 
/ = 1 

and, from Equation 3.7, 

i = —{h + k) 

= -(1 - 1 ) = 0 

Therefore the (hkil ) indices are (lTOl). 

Notice that the third index is zero (i.e., its reciprocal = oo), which means 
that this plane parallels the a 3 axis. Inspection of the preceding figure shows 
that this is indeed the case. 


3.11 LINEAR AND PLANAR DENSITIES 

The two previous sections discussed the equivalency of nonparallel crystallographic 
directions and planes. Directional equivalency is related to linear density in the sense 
that, for a particular material, equivalent directions have identical linear densities. 
The corresponding parameter for crystallographic planes is planar density , and 
planes having the same planar density values are also equivalent. 












3.12 Close-Packed Crystal Structures * 69 




Figure 3.13 (a) Reduced-sphere FCC unit cell with the [110] direction indicated. (6) The 
bottom face-plane of the FCC unit cell in (a) on which is shown the atomic spacing in the 
[110] direction, through atoms labeled X, Y, and Z. 


Linear density (LD) is defined as the number of atoms per unit length whose 
centers lie on the direction vector for a specific crystallographic direction; that is, 


LD 


number of atoms centered on direction vector 
length of direction vector 


(3.8) 


Of course, the units of linear density are reciprocal length (e.g., nm -1 , m -1 ). 

For example, let us determine the linear density of the [110] direction for the 
FCC crystal structure. An FCC unit cell (reduced sphere) and the [110] direction 
therein are shown in Figure 3.13a. Represented in Figure 3.136 are the five atoms 
that lie on the bottom face of this unit cell; here the [110] direction vector passes 
from the center of atom X , through atom Y, and finally to the center of atom Z. 
With regard to the numbers of atoms, it is necessary to take into account the shar¬ 
ing of atoms with adjacent unit cells (as discussed in Section 3.4 relative to atomic 
packing factor computations). Each of the X and Z corner atoms is also shared with 
one other adjacent unit cell along this [110] direction (i.e., one-half of each of these 
atoms belongs to the unit cell being considered), while atom Y lies entirely within 
the unit cell. Thus, there is an equivalence of two atoms along the [110] direction 
vector in the unit cell. Now, the direction vector length is equal to 4 R (Figure 3.136); 
thus, from Equation 3.8, the [110] linear density for FCC is 


_ 2 atoms _ 1 

LDno - = m 


(3.9) 


In an analogous manner, planar density (PD) is taken as the number of atoms 
per unit area that are centered on a particular crystallographic plane, or 


number of atoms centered on a plane 
PD = - are, of plane -~ < 310 > 

The units for planar density are reciprocal area (e.g., nm“ 2 , m -2 ). 

For example, consider the section of a (110) plane within an FCC unit cell as 
represented in Figures 3.11a and 3.116. Although six atoms have centers that lie on 
this plane (Figure 3.116), only one-quarter of each of atoms A, C, D, and F, and 
one-half of atoms B and E, for a total equivalence of just 2 atoms, are on that plane. 
Furthermore, the area of this rectangular section is equal to the product of its length 
and width. From Figure 3.116, the length (horizontal dimension) is equal to 4 R, 

















70 * Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 


whereas the width (vertical dimension) is equal to 2 R V2 , because it corresponds 
to the FCC unit cell edge length (Equation 3.1). Thus, the area of this planar re¬ 
gion is (4R)( 2Rs/2 ) = 8R 2 V2 , and the planar density is determined as follows: 


PD 110 — 


2 atoms 

8jR 2 V2

4jR 2 V2 


(3.11) 


Linear and planar densities are important considerations relative to the process of 
slip—that is, the mechanism by which metals plastically deform (Section 7.4). Slip 
occurs on the most densely packed crystallographic planes and, in those planes, 
along directions having the greatest atomic packing. 


3.12 CLOSE-PACKED CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 


VMSE 



Close-Packed 
Structures (Metals) 


You may remember from the discussion on metallic crystal structures that both face- 
centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed crystal structures have atomic packing fac¬ 
tors of 0.74, which is the most efficient packing of equal-sized spheres or atoms. In 
addition to unit cell representations, these two crystal structures may be described in 
terms of close-packed planes of atoms (i.e., planes having a maximum atom or sphere¬ 
packing density); a portion of one such plane is illustrated in Figure 3.14 a. Both crys¬ 
tal structures may be generated by the stacking of these close-packed planes on top of 
one another; the difference between the two structures lies in the stacking sequence. 

Let the centers of all the atoms in one close-packed plane be labeled A. Asso¬ 
ciated with this plane are two sets of equivalent triangular depressions formed by 
three adjacent atoms, into which the next close-packed plane of atoms may rest. 
Those having the triangle vertex pointing up are arbitrarily designated as B posi¬ 
tions, while the remaining depressions are those with the down vertices, which are 
marked C in Figure 3.14a. 

A second close-packed plane may be positioned with the centers of its atoms 
over either B or C sites; at this point both are equivalent. Suppose that the B 
positions are arbitrarily chosen; the stacking sequence is termed AB , which is 




Figure 3.14 (a) A portion of 
a close-packed plane of 
atoms; A, B , and C positions 
are indicated. ( b ) The AB

illustrated in Figure 3.14Z?.The real distinction between FCC and HCP lies in where 
the third close-packed layer is positioned. For HCP, the centers of this layer are 
aligned directly above the original A positions. This stacking sequence, ABABAB ..., 
is repeated over and over. Of course, the AC AC AC ... arrangement would be equiv¬ 
alent. These close-packed planes for HCP are (OOOl)-type planes, and the corre¬ 
spondence between this and the unit cell representation is shown in Figure 3.15. 

For the face-centered crystal structure, the centers of the third plane are situated 
over the C sites of the first plane (Figure 3.16a). This yields an ABCABCABC . .. 
stacking sequence; that is, the atomic alignment repeats every third plane. It is more 
difficult to correlate the stacking of close-packed planes to the FCC unit cell. How¬ 
ever, this relationship is demonstrated in Figure 3.16Z>.These planes are of the (111) 
type; an FCC unit cell is outlined on the upper left-hand front face of Figure 3.1 6b,

in order to provide a perspective. The significance of these FCC and HCP close- 
packed planes will become apparent in Chapter 7. 

The concepts detailed in the previous four sections also relate to crystalline 
ceramic and polymeric materials, which are discussed in Chapters 12 and 14. We 
may specify crystallographic planes and directions in terms of directional and Miller 
indices; furthermore, on occasion it is important to ascertain the atomic and ionic 
arrangements of particular crystallographic planes. Also, the crystal structures of a 
number of ceramic materials may be generated by the stacking of close-packed 
planes of ions (Section 12.2). 

Crystalline and Noncrystalline Materials 


3.13 SINGLE CRYSTALS 

For a crystalline solid, when the periodic and repeated arrangement of atoms is per¬ 
fect or extends throughout the entirety of the specimen without interruption, the re¬ 
single crystal suit is a single crystal. All unit cells interlock in the same way and have the same ori¬ 

entation. Single crystals exist in nature, but they may also be produced artificially. They 
are ordinarily difficult to grow, because the environment must be carefully controlled. 

If the extremities of a single crystal are permitted to grow without any exter¬ 
nal constraint, the crystal will assume a regular geometric shape having flat faces, 
as with some of the gemstones; the shape is indicative of the crystal structure. A 
photograph of a garnet single crystal is shown in Figure 3.17. Within the past few 
years, single crystals have become extremely important in many of our modern tech¬ 
nologies, in particular electronic microcircuits, which employ single crystals of sili¬ 
con and other semiconductors. 


3.14 POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS

Most crystalline solids are composed of a collection of many small crystals or grains; 
such materials are termed polycrystalline. Various stages in the solidification of a 
polycrystalline specimen are represented schematically in Figure 3.18. Initially, small 
crystals or nuclei form at various positions. These have random crystallographic

orientations, as indicated by the square grids. The small grains grow by the successive 
addition from the surrounding liquid of atoms to the structure of each. The extremities 
of adjacent grains impinge on one another as the solidification process approaches com¬ 
pletion. As indicated in Figure 3.18, the crystallographic orientation varies from grain 
to grain. Also, there exists some atomic mismatch within the region where two grains 
grain boundary meet; this area, called a grain boundary, is discussed in more detail in Section 4.6. 

3.15 ANISOTROPY 

The physical properties of single crystals of some substances depend on the crystal¬ 
lographic direction in which measurements are taken. For example, the elastic mod¬ 
ulus, the electrical conductivity, and the index of refraction may have different val¬ 
ues in the [100] and [111] directions. This directionality of properties is termed 
anisotropy, and it is associated with the variance of atomic or ionic spacing with crys¬ 
tallographic direction. Substances in which measured properties are independent of 
the direction of measurement are isotropic. The extent and magnitude of anisotropic 
effects in crystalline materials are functions of the symmetry of the crystal structure; 
the degree of anisotropy increases with decreasing structural symmetry—triclinic 
structures normally are highly anisotropic. The modulus of elasticity values at [100], 
[110], and [111] orientations for several materials are presented in Table 3.3.

For many polycrystalline materials, the crystallographic orientations of the indi¬ 
vidual grains are totally random. Under these circumstances, even though each grain 
may be anisotropic, a specimen composed of the grain aggregate behaves isotropically. 
Also, the magnitude of a measured property represents some average of the direc¬ 
tional values. Sometimes the grains in polycrystalline materials have a preferential crys¬ 
tallographic orientation, in which case the material is said to have a “texture.” 

The magnetic properties of some iron alloys used in transformer cores are 
anisotropic—that is, grains (or single crystals) magnetize in a (lOO)-type direction 
easier than any other crystallographic direction. Energy losses in transformer cores 
are minimized by utilizing polycrystalline sheets of these alloys into which have 
been introduced a “magnetic texture”: most of the grains in each sheet have a 
(lOO)-type crystallographic direction that is aligned (or almost aligned) in the same 
direction, which is oriented parallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field. 
Magnetic textures for iron alloys are discussed in detail in the Material of Impor¬ 
tance box in Chapter 20 following Section 20.9. 

3.16 X-RAY DIFFRACTION: DETERMINATION 
OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 

Historically, much of our understanding regarding the atomic and molecular 
arrangements in solids has resulted from x-ray diffraction investigations; further¬ 
more, x-rays are still very important in developing new materials. We will now give 
a brief overview of the diffraction phenomenon and how, using x-rays, atomic in- 
terplanar distances and crystal structures are deduced. 

The Diffraction Phenomenon 

Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters a series of regularly spaced obstacles 
that (1) are capable of scattering the wave, and (2) have spacings that are compa¬ 
rable in magnitude to the wavelength. Furthermore, diffraction is a consequence of 
specific phase relationships established between two or more waves that have been 
scattered by the obstacles. 

Consider waves 1 and 2 in Figure 3.19a, which have the same wavelength (A) 
and are in phase at point O-O'. Now let us suppose that both waves are scattered 
in such a way that they traverse different paths. The phase relationship between the 
scattered waves, which will depend upon the difference in path length, is important. 
One possibility results when this path length difference is an integral number of 
wavelengths. As noted in Figure 3.19a, these scattered waves (now labeled V and 2')

are still in phase. They are said to mutually reinforce (or constructively interfere 
with) one another; and, when amplitudes are added, the wave shown on the right 
side of the figure results. This is a manifestation of diffraction, and we refer to a 
diffracted beam as one composed of a large number of scattered waves that mutu¬ 
ally reinforce one another. 

Other phase relationships are possible between scattered waves that will not lead 
to this mutual reinforcement. The other extreme is that demonstrated in Figure 3.19 b, 
wherein the path length difference after scattering is some integral number of half- 
wavelengths. The scattered waves are out of phase—that is, corresponding amplitudes 
cancel or annul one another, or destructively interfere (i.e., the resultant wave has zero 
amplitude), as indicated on the right side of the figure. Of course, phase relationships 
intermediate between these two extremes exist, resulting in only partial reinforcement. 

X-Ray Diffraction and Bragg's Law 

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that have high energies and short 
wavelengths—wavelengths on the order of the atomic spacings for solids. When a 
beam of x-rays impinges on a solid material, a portion of this beam will be scat¬ 
tered in all directions by the electrons associated with each atom or ion that lies 
within the beam’s path. Let us now examine the necessary conditions for diffrac¬ 
tion of x-rays by a periodic arrangement of atoms. 

Consider the two parallel planes of atoms A-A' and B-B' in Figure 3.20, which 
have the same h, k, and / Miller indices and are separated by the interplanar 
spacing d m . Now assume that a parallel, monochromatic, and coherent (in-phase)

beam of x-rays of wavelength A is incident on these two planes at an angle 6. Two 
rays in this beam, labeled 1 and 2, are scattered by atoms P and Q. Constructive in¬ 
terference of the scattered rays V and 2' occurs also at an angle 6 to the planes, if 
the path length difference between 1—P—1' and 2-0-2' (i.e., SQ + QT) is equal 
to a whole number, n, of wavelengths. That is, the condition for diffraction is 

nX = SQ + QT (3.12) 


or 


n\ = d hM sin 6 + d hki sin 6 
= 2d hk i sin 6 


(3.13) 


Bragg’s law 


Interplanar spacing 
for a plane having 
indices h, k, and l 


Equation 3.13 is known as Bragg’s law; also, n is the order of reflection, which 
may be any integer (1, 2, 3,. . .) consistent with sin 6 not exceeding unity. Thus, we 
have a simple expression relating the x-ray wavelength and interatomic spacing to 
the angle of the diffracted beam. If Bragg’s law is not satisfied, then the interference 
will be nonconstructive in nature so as to yield a very low-intensity diffracted beam. 

The magnitude of the distance between two adjacent and parallel planes of atoms 
(i.e., the interplanar spacing d hkt ) is a function of the Miller indices (//, k, and /) as well 
as the lattice parameter(s). For example, for crystal structures that have cubic symmetry, 


dhki — 


Vi? + i? + T 2 


(3.14) 


in which a is the lattice parameter (unit cell edge length). Relationships similar to Equa¬ 
tion 3.14, but more complex, exist for the other six crystal systems noted in Table 3.2. 

Bragg’s law, Equation 3.13, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for dif¬ 
fraction by real crystals. It specifies when diffraction will occur for unit cells having 
atoms positioned only at cell corners. Flowever, atoms situated at other sites (e.g., face 
and interior unit cell positions as with FCC and BCC) act as extra scattering centers, 
which can produce out-of-phase scattering at certain Bragg angles. The net result is 
the absence of some diffracted beams that, according to Equation 3.13, should be 
present. For example, for the BCC crystal structure, h + k + / must be even if dif¬ 
fraction is to occur, whereas for FCC, h, k , and l must all be either odd or even.

For cubic crystals, as values of the planar indices /z, /c, and / increase, does the dis¬ 
tance between adjacent and parallel planes (i.e., the interplanar spacing) increase 
or decrease? Why?

Diffraction Techniques 

One common diffraction technique employs a powdered or polycrystalline speci¬ 
men consisting of many fine and randomly oriented particles that are exposed to 
monochromatic x-radiation. Each powder particle (or grain) is a crystal, and hav¬ 
ing a large number of them with random orientations ensures that some particles 
are properly oriented such that every possible set of crystallographic planes will be 
available for diffraction. 

The diffractometer is an apparatus used to determine the angles at which dif¬ 
fraction occurs for powdered specimens; its features are represented schematically 
in Figure 3.21. A specimen S in the form of a flat plate is supported so that rotations 
about the axis labeled O are possible; this axis is perpendicular to the plane of the 
page. The monochromatic x-ray beam is generated at point 7, and the intensities of 
diffracted beams are detected with a counter labeled C in the figure. The specimen, 
x-ray source, and counter are all coplanar. 

The counter is mounted on a movable carriage that may also be rotated about 
the O axis; its angular position in terms of 29 is marked on a graduated scale. 4 
Carriage and specimen are mechanically coupled such that a rotation of the speci¬ 
men through 9 is accompanied by a 29 rotation of the counter; this ensures that the 
incident and reflection angles are maintained equal to one another (Figure 3.21). 
Collimators are incorporated within the beam path to produce a well-defined and 
focused beam. Utilization of a filter provides a near-monochromatic beam. 

As the counter moves at constant angular velocity, a recorder automatically plots 
the diffracted beam intensity (monitored by the counter) as a function of 29; 29 is 


4 Note that the symbol 6 has been used in two different contexts for this discussion. Here, 

6 represents the angular locations of both x-ray source and counter relative to the specimen 
surface. Previously (e.g., Equation 3.13), it denoted the angle at which the Bragg criterion 
for diffraction is satisfied.

termed the diffraction angle, which is measured experimentally. Figure 3.22 shows a 
diffraction pattern for a polycrystalline specimen of a-iron. The high-intensity peaks 
result when the Bragg diffraction condition is satisfied by some set of crystallographic 
planes. These peaks are plane-indexed in the figure. 

Other powder techniques have been devised wherein diffracted beam intensity and 
position are recorded on a photographic film instead of being measured by a counter. 

One of the primary uses of x-ray diffractometry is for the determination of crys¬ 
tal structure. The unit cell size and geometry may be resolved from the angular po¬ 
sitions of the diffraction peaks, whereas arrangement of atoms within the unit cell 
is associated with the relative intensities of these peaks. 

X-rays, as well as electron and neutron beams, are also used in other types of 
material investigations. For example, crystallographic orientations of single crystals 
are possible using x-ray diffraction (or Laue) photographs. The ( a ) chapter-opening 
photograph for this chapter was generated using an incident x-ray beam that was 
directed on a magnesium crystal; each spot (with the exception of the darkest one 
near the center) resulted from an x-ray beam that was diffracted by a specific set of 
crystallographic planes. Other uses of x-rays include qualitative and quantitative 
chemical identifications and the determination of residual stresses and crystal size. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 3.13 


Interplanar Spacing and Diffraction Angle Computations 

For BCC iron, compute (a) the interplanar spacing and (b) the diffraction an¬ 
gle for the (220) set of planes. The lattice parameter for Fe is 0.2866 nm. Also, 
assume that monochromatic radiation having a wavelength of 0.1790 nm is 
used, and the order of reflection is 1. 


Solution 

(a) The value of the interplanar spacing d hkl is determined using Equation 
3.14, with a = 0.2866 nm, and h = 2, k = 2, and / = 0, because we are 
considering the (220) planes. Therefore,

because this is a first-order reflection:

The diffraction angle is 26 , or 

20 = (2)(62.13°) = 124.26° 


3.17 NONCRYSTALLINE SOLIDS 

noncrystalline It has been mentioned that noncrystalline solids lack a systematic and regular 

arrangement of atoms over relatively large atomic distances. Sometimes such ma- 
amorphous terials are also called amorphous (meaning literally “without form”), or supercooled 

liquids, inasmuch as their atomic structure resembles that of a liquid. 

An amorphous condition may be illustrated by comparison of the crystalline 
and noncrystalline structures of the ceramic compound silicon dioxide (Si0 2 ), which 
may exist in both states. Figures 3.23a and 3.23 b present two-dimensional schematic 
diagrams for both structures of Si0 2 . Even though each silicon ion bonds to three 
oxygen ions for both states, beyond this, the structure is much more disordered and 
irregular for the noncrystalline structure. 

Whether a crystalline or amorphous solid forms depends on the ease with which 
a random atomic structure in the liquid can transform to an ordered state during so¬ 
lidification. Amorphous materials, therefore, are characterized by atomic or molecular 
structures that are relatively complex and become ordered only with some difficulty. 
Furthermore, rapidly cooling through the freezing temperature favors the formation 
of a noncrystalline solid, because little time is allowed for the ordering process. 

Metals normally form crystalline solids, but some ceramic materials are crystalline, 
whereas others, the inorganic glasses, are amorphous. Polymers may be completely 
noncrystalline and semicrystalline consisting of varying degrees of crystallinity.

SUMMARY 


Fundamental Concepts 

• Atoms in crystalline solids are positioned in orderly and repeated patterns that 
are in contrast to the random and disordered atomic distribution found in non¬ 
crystalline or amorphous materials. 

Unit Cells 

• Crystal structures are specified in terms of parallelepiped unit cells, which are 
characterized by geometry and atom positions within. 

Metallic Crystal Structures 

• Most common metals exist in at least one of three relatively simple crystal 
structures: 

Face-centered cubic (FCC), which has a cubic unit cell (Figure 3.1). 

Body-centered cubic (BCC), which also has a cubic unit cell (Figure 3.2). 

Ftexagonal close-packed, which has a unit cell of hexagonal symmetry, 
[Figure 3.3(a)]. 

• Unit cell edge length ( a ) and atomic radius ( R ) are related according to 

Equation 3.1 for face-centered cubic, and 

Equation 3.3 for body-centered cubic. 

• Two features of a crystal structure are 

Coordination number—the number of nearest-neighbor atoms, and 

Atomic packing factor—the fraction of solid sphere volume in the unit cell. 

Density Computations 

• The theoretical density of a metal (p) is a function of the number of equivalent 
atoms per unit cell, the atomic weight, unit cell volume, and Avogadro’s number 
(Equation 3.5). 

Polymorphism and Allotropy 

• Polymorphism is when a specific material can have more than one crystal struc¬ 
ture. Allotropy is polymorphism for elemental solids. 

Crystal Systems 

• The concept of crystal system is used to classify crystal structures on the basis of 
unit cell geometry—that is, unit cell edge lengths and interaxial angles. There are 
seven crystal systems: cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral 
(trigonal), monoclinic, and triclinic. 






Summary * 81 


Point Coordinates 

Crystallographic Directions 

Crystallographic Planes 

• Crystallographic points, directions, and planes are specified in terms of indexing 
schemes. The basis for the determination of each index is a coordinate axis system 
defined by the unit cell for the particular crystal structure. 

The location of a point within a unit cell is specified using coordinates that 
are fractional multiples of the cell edge lengths. 

Directional indices are computed in terms of the vector projection on each 
of the coordinate axes. 

Planar (or Miller) indices are determined from the reciprocals of axial intercepts. 

• For hexagonal unit cells, a four-index scheme for both directions and planes is 
found to be more convenient. 

Linear and Planar Densities 

• Crystallographic directional and planar equivalencies are related to atomic lin¬ 
ear and planar densities, respectively. 

Linear density (for a specific crystallographic direction) is defined as the num¬ 
ber of atoms per unit length whose centers lie on the vector for this di¬ 
rection (Equation 3.8). 

Planar density (for a specific crystallographic plane) is taken as the number of 
atoms per unit area that are centered on the particular plane (Equation 3.10). 

• For a given crystal structure, planes having identical atomic packing yet different 
Miller indices belong to the same family. 

Close-Packed Crystal Structures 

• Both FCC and FICP crystal structures may be generated by the stacking of close- 
packed planes of atoms on top of one another. With this scheme A , B , and C 
denote possible atom positions on a close-packed plane. 

The stacking sequence for HCP is ABABAB .. . . 

For FCC the stacking sequence is ABCABCABC ... . 

• Close-packed planes for FCC and HCP are {111} and {0001}, respectively. 

Single Crystals 

Polycrystalline Materials 

• Single crystals are materials in which the atomic order extends uninterrupted over 
the entirety of the specimen; under some circumstances, single crystals may have 
flat faces and regular geometric shapes. 

• The vast majority of crystalline solids, however, are poly crystalline, being composed 
of many small crystals or grains having different crystallographic orientations. 

• A grain boundary is the boundary region separating two grains, wherein there is 
some atomic mismatch. 

Anisotropy 

• Anisotropy is the directionality dependence of properties. For isotropic materi¬ 
als, properties are independent of the direction of measurement. 

X-Ray Diffraction: Determination of Crystal Structures 

• X-ray diffractometry is used for crystal structure and interplanar spacing deter¬ 
minations. A beam of x-rays directed on a crystalline material may experience 


82 


Chapter 3 / The Structure of Crystalline Solids 


diffraction (constructive interference) as a result of its interaction with a series 
of parallel atomic planes. 

• Bragg’s law specifies the condition for diffraction of x-rays—Equation 3.13. 

Noncrystalline Solids 

• Noncrystalline solid materials lack a systematic and regular arrangement of atoms 
or ions over relatively large distances (on an atomic scale). Sometimes the term 
amorphous is also used to describe these materials.

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

In this chapter we discussed crystal structure, the body-centered cubic crystal struc¬ 
ture, and the ability of a metal to experience a change in its crystal structure (poly¬ 
morphism). A knowledge of these concepts helps us understand the transformation 
of BCC iron to martensite (which has another crystal structure) in Chapter 10. This 
relationship is represented by the following diagram:

Also discussed was the notion of a noncrystalline material. Glass-ceramics 
(Chapter 13) are formed as noncrystalline silica glasses (Chapter 12), which are then 
heat-treated so as to become crystalline in nature. The following diagram notes this

WHY STUDY Imperfections in Solids? 


The properties of some materials are profoundly influ¬ 
enced by the presence of imperfections. Consequently, 
it is important to have a knowledge about the types of 
imperfections that exist and the roles they play in 
affecting the behavior of materials. For example, the 
mechanical properties of pure metals experience 
significant alterations when alloyed (i.e., when impurity 
atoms are added)—for example, brass (70% copper/30% 
zinc) is much harder and stronger than pure copper 
(Section 7.9). 

Also, integrated-circuit microelectronic devices 
found in our computers, calculators, and home 
appliances function because of highly controlled 
concentrations of specific impurities that are incorpo¬ 
rated into small, localized regions of semiconducting 
materials (Sections 18.11 and 18.15). 


In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying imperfections in solids are 
as follows: 

• For the processing of silicon as a semiconducting 
material, it is important to specify impurity 
concentration in appropriate units. 

• Development of the desirable mechanical properties 
for steel alloys relies on the presence of specific 
impurities, some of which form solid solutions. Thus, 
an understanding of the concept of a solid solution 
is important. 

• The mechanisms of hardening and strengthening for 
steel alloys involve a crystalline defect called a 
dislocation. In this chapter we discuss the dislocation 
concept and the different types. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe both vacancy and self-interstitial crys¬ 
talline defects. 

2. Calculate the equilibrium number of vacancies 
in a material at some specified temperature, 
given the relevant constants. 

3. Name the two types of solid solutions and pro¬ 
vide a brief written definition and/or schematic 
sketch of each. 

4. Given the masses and atomic weights of two 
or more elements in a metal alloy, calculate 


the weight percent and atom percent for each 
element. 

5. For each of edge, screw, and mixed dislocations: 

(a) describe and make a drawing of the 
dislocation, 

(b) note the location of the dislocation line, and 

(c) indicate the direction along which the dis¬ 
location line extends. 

6. Describe the atomic structure within the vicinity 
of (a) a grain boundary and (b) a twin boundary. 


4.1 INTRODUCTION 

Thus far it has been tacitly assumed that perfect order exists throughout crystalline 
materials on an atomic scale. However, such an idealized solid does not exist; all 
imperfection contain large numbers of various defects or imperfections. As a matter of fact, many 

of the properties of materials are profoundly sensitive to deviations from crystalline 
perfection; the influence is not always adverse, and often specific characteristics are 
deliberately fashioned by the introduction of controlled amounts or numbers of 
particular defects, as detailed in succeeding chapters. 

Crystalline defect refers to a lattice irregularity having one or more of its 
dimensions on the order of an atomic diameter. Classification of crystalline imper¬ 
fections is frequently made according to geometry or dimensionality of the defect.

point defect Several different imperfections are discussed in this chapter, including point defects 

(those associated with one or two atomic positions), linear (or one-dimensional) 
defects, and interfacial defects, or boundaries, which are two-dimensional. Impuri¬ 
ties in solids are also discussed, because impurity atoms may exist as point defects. 
Finally, techniques for the microscopic examination of defects and the structure of 
materials are briefly described. 

Point Defects 


4.2 VACANCIES AND SELF-INTERSTITIALS 

vacancy The simplest of the point defects is a vacancy, or vacant lattice site, one normally 

occupied from which an atom is missing (Figure 4.1). All crystalline solids contain 
vacancies and, in fact, it is not possible to create such a material that is free of these 
defects. The necessity of the existence of vacancies is explained using principles of 
thermodynamics; in essence, the presence of vacancies increases the entropy (i.e., 
the randomness) of the crystal. 

The equilibrium number of vacancies N v for a given quantity of material 
depends on and increases with temperature according to 

Temperature 
dependence of the 

equilibrium number — A exp 

of vacancies 



In this expression, N is the total number of atomic sites, Q v is the energy required 
for the formation of a vacancy, T is the absolute temperature 1 in kelvins, and k is 
Boltzmann’s the gas or Boltzmann’s constant. The value of k is 1.38 X 1CT 23 J/atom • K, or 8.62 X 

constant 10 -5 eV/atom • K, depending on the units of Q v ? Thus, the number of vacancies 


1 Absolute temperature in kelvins (K) is equal to °C + 273. 

2 Boltzmann’s constant per mole of atoms becomes the gas constant R ; in such a case R = 
8.31 J/mol-K. 






4.3 Impurities in Solids * 93 


increases exponentially with temperature; that is, as T in Equation 4.1 increases, so 
also does the expression exp — ( QJkT ). For most metals, the fraction of vacancies 
NJN just below the melting temperature is on the order of 10 -4 ; that is, one lattice 
site out of 10,000 will be empty. As ensuing discussions indicate, a number of other 
material parameters have an exponential dependence on temperature similar to 
that of Equation 4.1. 

self-interstitial A self-interstitial is an atom from the crystal that is crowded into an intersti¬ 

tial site, a small void space that under ordinary circumstances is not occupied. This 
kind of defect is also represented in Figure 4.1. In metals, a self-interstitial intro¬ 
duces relatively large distortions in the surrounding lattice because the atom is sub¬ 
stantially larger than the interstitial position in which it is situated. Consequently, 
the formation of this defect is not highly probable, and it exists in very small con¬ 
centrations, which are significantly lower than for vacancies. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 4.1 

Number-of-Vacancies Computation 
at a Specified Temperature 

Calculate the equilibrium number of vacancies per cubic meter for copper at 
1000°C. The energy for vacancy formation is 0.9 eV/atom; the atomic weight 
and density (at 1000°C) for copper are 63.5 g/mol and 8.4 g/cm 3 , respectively.

per unit volume for 
a metal 


Solution 

This problem may be solved by using Equation 4.1; it is first necessary, how¬ 
ever, to determine the value of A, the number of atomic sites per cubic meter 
for copper, from its atomic weight A Cu , its density p, and Avogadro’s number 
N a , according to 


N =

63.5 g/mol 

= 8.0 X 10 28 atoms/m 3 


(4.2) 


Thus, the number of vacancies at 1000°C (1273 K) is equal to 


», = «exp(-^) 

= (8.0 X 10 28 atoms/m 3 ) exp 


(0.9 eV) 

(8.62 X 10“ 5 eV/K)(1273 K)_ 


= 2.2 X 10 25 vacancies/m 3 


4.3 IMPURITIES IN SOLIDS 

A pure metal consisting of only one type of atom just isn’t possible; impurity or for¬ 
eign atoms will always be present, and some will exist as crystalline point defects. 
In fact, even with relatively sophisticated techniques, it is difficult to refine metals 
to a purity in excess of 99.9999%. At this level, on the order of 10 22 to 10 23 impu¬ 
rity atoms will be present in one cubic meter of material. Most familiar metals are

not highly pure; rather, they are alloys, in which impurity atoms have been added 
intentionally to impart specific characteristics to the material. Ordinarily, alloying 
is used in metals to improve mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. For ex¬ 
ample, sterling silver is a 92.5% silver/7.5 % copper alloy. In normal ambient envi¬ 
ronments, pure silver is highly corrosion resistant, but also very soft. Alloying with 
copper significantly enhances the mechanical strength without depreciating the cor¬ 
rosion resistance appreciably. 

The addition of impurity atoms to a metal will result in the formation of a solid 
solution and/or a new second phase , depending on the kinds of impurity, their con¬ 
centrations, and the temperature of the alloy. The present discussion is concerned 
with the notion of a solid solution; treatment of the formation of a new phase is 
deferred to Chapter 9. 

Several terms relating to impurities and solid solutions deserve mention. With 
regard to alloys, solute and solvent are terms that are commonly employed. Solvent 
represents the element or compound that is present in the greatest amount; on oc¬ 
casion, solvent atoms are also called host atoms. Solute is used to denote an ele¬ 
ment or compound present in a minor concentration. 


Solid Solutions 

A solid solution forms when, as the solute atoms are added to the host material, 
the crystal structure is maintained and no new structures are formed. Perhaps it is 
useful to draw an analogy with a liquid solution. If two liquids, soluble in each other 
(such as water and alcohol) are combined, a liquid solution is produced as the mol¬ 
ecules intermix, and its composition is homogeneous throughout. A solid solution 
is also compositionally homogeneous; the impurity atoms are randomly and uni¬ 
formly dispersed within the solid. 

Impurity point defects are found in solid solutions, of which there are two types: 
substitutional and interstitial. For the substitutional type, solute or impurity atoms 
replace or substitute for the host atoms (Figure 4.2). Several features of the solute 
and solvent atoms determine the degree to which the former dissolves in the lat¬ 
ter, as follows: 

1. Atomic size factor. Appreciable quantities of a solute may be accommodated 
in this type of solid solution only when the difference in atomic radii be¬ 
tween the two atom types is less than about ±15 % Otherwise the solute 
atoms will create substantial lattice distortions and a new phase will form.

4.4 Specification of Composition * 95 


2. Crystal structure. For appreciable solid solubility the crystal structures for 
metals of both atom types must be the same. 

3. Electronegativity. The more electropositive one element and the more elec¬ 
tronegative the other, the greater the likelihood that they will form an inter- 
metallic compound instead of a substitutional solid solution. 

4. Valences. Other factors being equal, a metal will have more of a tendency to 
dissolve another metal of higher valency than one of a lower valency. 

An example of a substitutional solid solution is found for copper and nickel. 
These two elements are completely soluble in one another at all proportions. With 
regard to the aforementioned rules that govern degree of solubility, the atomic radii 
for copper and nickel are 0.128 and 0.125 nm, respectively; both have the FCC crys¬ 
tal structure; and their electronegativities are 1.9 and 1.8 (Figure 2.7); finally, the 
most common valences are +1 for copper (although it sometimes can be +2) and 
+2 for nickel. 

For interstitial solid solutions, impurity atoms fill the voids or interstices among 
the host atoms (see Figure 4.2). For metallic materials that have relatively high 
atomic packing factors, these interstitial positions are relatively small. Consequently, 
the atomic diameter of an interstitial impurity must be substantially smaller than 
that of the host atoms. Normally, the maximum allowable concentration of inter¬ 
stitial impurity atoms is low (less than 10%). Even very small impurity atoms are 
ordinarily larger than the interstitial sites, and as a consequence they introduce some 
lattice strains on the adjacent host atoms. Problem 4.5 calls for determination of 
the radii of impurity atoms (in terms of R , the host atom radius) that will just fit 
into interstitial positions without introducing any lattice strains for both FCC and 
BCC crystal structures. 

Carbon forms an interstitial solid solution when added to iron; the maximum 
concentration of carbon is about 2%. The atomic radius of the carbon atom is much 
less than that for iron: 0.071 nm versus 0.124 nm. Solid solutions are also possible 
for ceramic materials, as discussed in Section 12.5. 

4.4 SPECIFICATION OF COMPOSITION 

It is often necessary to express the composition (or concentration ) 3 of an alloy in 
terms of its constituent elements. The two most common ways to specify composi¬ 
tion are weight (or mass) percent and atom percent. The basis for weight percent 
(wt%) is the weight of a particular element relative to the total alloy weight. For 
an alloy that contains two hypothetical atoms denoted by 1 and 2, the concentra¬ 
tion of 1 in wt%, C 1? is defined as 

Computation of C, = —— X 100 (4.3) 

weight percent (for m 1 + m 2 

a two-element alloy) 

where /% and m 2 represent the weight (or mass) of elements 1 and 2, respectively. 
The concentration of 2 would be computed in an analogous manner, 
atom percent The basis for atom percent (at%) calculations is the number of moles of an 

element in relation to the total moles of the elements in the alloy. The number of

weight percent 


3 The terms composition and concentration will be assumed to have the same meaning in 
this book (i.e., the relative content of a specific element or constituent in an alloy) and will 
be used interchangeably.

moles in some specified mass of a hypothetical element 1, n ml , may be computed 
as follows: 


^ml

(4.4) 


Here, m[ and A 1 denote the mass (in grams) and atomic weight, respectively, for 
element 1. 

Concentration in terms of atom percent of element 1 in an alloy containing 
element 1 and element 2 atoms, C[ is defined by 4

(4.5) 


In like manner, the atom percent of element 2 may be determined. 

Atom percent computations also can be carried out on the basis of the num¬ 
ber of atoms instead of moles, because one mole of all substances contains the same 
number of atoms. 

Composition Conversions 

Sometimes it is necessary to convert from one composition scheme to another— 
for example, from weight percent to atom percent. We will now present equations 
for making these conversions in terms of the two hypothetical elements 1 and 2. 
Using the convention of the previous section (i.e., weight percents denoted by C, 
and C 2 , atom percents by C[ and C 2 , and atomic weights as A, and A 2 ), these con¬ 
version expressions are as follows:

Because we are considering only two elements, computations involving the pre¬ 
ceding equations are simplified when it is realized that 

C, + C 2 = 100 (4.8a) 

C[ + C 2 = 100 (4.8b) 

In addition, it sometimes becomes necessary to convert concentration from 
weight percent to mass of one component per unit volume of material (i.e., from 
units of wt% to kg/m 3 ); this latter composition scheme is often used in diffusion 


4 In order to avoid confusion in notations and symbols that are being used in this section, 
we should point out that the prime (as in C[ and m[) is used to designate both composi¬ 
tion, in atom percent, and mass of material in units of grams.

It should be noted that Equations 4.9 and 4.11 are not always exact. In their 
derivations, it is assumed that total alloy volume is exactly equal to the sum of the 
volumes of the individual elements. This normally is not the case for most alloys; 
however, it is a reasonably valid assumption and does not lead to significant errors 
for dilute solutions and over composition ranges where solid solutions exist.

To simplify this derivation, we will assume that masses are expressed in units

A dislocation is a linear or one-dimensional defect around which some of the atoms 
are misaligned. One type of dislocation is represented in Figure 4.3: an extra portion 
of a plane of atoms, or half-plane, the edge of which terminates within the crystal. 
This is termed an edge dislocation; it is a linear defect that centers on the line that 
is defined along the end of the extra half-plane of atoms. This is sometimes termed 
the dislocation line, which, for the edge dislocation in Figure 4.3, is perpendicular to 
the plane of the page. Within the region around the dislocation line there is some 
localized lattice distortion. The atoms above the dislocation line in Figure 4.3 are 
squeezed together, and those below are pulled apart; this is reflected in the slight 
curvature for the vertical planes of atoms as they bend around this extra half-plane. 
The magnitude of this distortion decreases with distance away from the dislocation 
line; at positions far removed, the crystal lattice is virtually perfect. Sometimes the 
edge dislocation in Figure 4.3 is represented by the symbol _L, which also indicates 
the position of the dislocation line. An edge dislocation may also be formed by an 
extra half-plane of atoms that is included in the bottom portion of the crystal; its 
designation is a T. 

Another type of dislocation, called a screw dislocation, may be thought of as 
being formed by a shear stress that is applied to produce the distortion shown in 
Figure 4.4a: the upper front region of the crystal is shifted one atomic distance to 
the right relative to the bottom portion. The atomic distortion associated with a 
screw dislocation is also linear and along a dislocation line, line AB in Figure AAb. 
The screw dislocation derives its name from the spiral or helical path or ramp that 
is traced around the dislocation line by the atomic planes of atoms. Sometimes the 
symbol tJ is used to designate a screw dislocation.

Mixed 


Most dislocations found in crystalline materials are probably neither pure edge 
nor pure screw, but exhibit components of both types; these are termed mixed dis¬ 
locations. All three dislocation types are represented schematically in Figure 4.5; 
the lattice distortion that is produced away from the two faces is mixed, having vary¬ 
ing degrees of screw and edge character.

indicated in Figures 4.3 and 4.4 for edge and screw dislocations, respectively. Further¬ 
more, the nature of a dislocation (i.e., edge, screw, or mixed) is defined by the relative 
orientations of dislocation line and Burgers vector. For an edge, they are perpendicular

(Figure 4.3), whereas for a screw, they are parallel (Figure 4.4); they are neither per¬ 
pendicular nor parallel for a mixed dislocation. Also, even though a dislocation 
changes direction and nature within a crystal (e.g., from edge to mixed to screw), the 
Burgers vector will be the same at all points along its line. For example, all positions 
of the curved dislocation in Figure 4.5 will have the Burgers vector shown. For metal¬ 
lic materials, the Burgers vector for a dislocation will point in a close-packed crystal¬ 
lographic direction and will be of magnitude equal to the interatomic spacing. 

As we note in Section 7.2, the permanent deformation of most crystalline ma¬ 
terials is by the motion of dislocations. In addition, the Burgers vector is an element 
of the theory that has been developed to explain this type of deformation. 

Dislocations can be observed in crystalline materials using electron-microscopic 
techniques. In Figure 4.6, a high-magnification transmission electron micrograph, 
the dark lines are the dislocations. 

Virtually all crystalline materials contain some dislocations that were intro¬ 
duced during solidification, during plastic deformation, and as a consequence of 
thermal stresses that result from rapid cooling. Dislocations are involved in the plas¬ 
tic deformation of crystalline materials, both metals and ceramics, as discussed in 
Chapters 7 and 12. They have also been observed in polymeric materials and are 
discussed in Section 14.13. 


4.6 INTERFACIAL DEFECTS 


Interfacial defects are boundaries that have two dimensions and normally separate 
regions of the materials that have different crystal structures and/or crystallographic 
orientations. These imperfections include external surfaces, grain boundaries, phase 
boundaries, twin boundaries, and stacking faults. 

External Surfaces 

One of the most obvious boundaries is the external surface, along which the crystal 
structure terminates. Surface atoms are not bonded to the maximum number of near¬ 
est neighbors, and are therefore in a higher energy state than the atoms at interior 
positions. The bonds of these surface atoms that are not satisfied give rise to a sur¬ 
face energy, expressed in units of energy per unit area (J/m 2 or erg/cm 2 ). To reduce

this energy, materials tend to minimize, if at all possible, the total surface area. For 
example, liquids assume a shape having a minimum area—the droplets become 
spherical. Of course, this is not possible with solids, which are mechanically rigid. 

Grain Boundaries 

Another interfacial defect, the grain boundary, was introduced in Section 3.14 as the 
boundary separating two small grains or crystals having different crystallographic 
orientations in polycrystalline materials. A grain boundary is represented schemati¬ 
cally from an atomic perspective in Figure 4.7. Within the boundary region, which is 
probably just several atom distances wide, there is some atomic mismatch in a tran¬ 
sition from the crystalline orientation of one grain to that of an adjacent one. 

Various degrees of crystallographic misalignment between adjacent grains are 
possible (Figure 4.7). When this orientation mismatch is slight, on the order of a few 
degrees, then the term small- (or low-) angle grain boundary is used. These bound¬ 
aries can be described in terms of dislocation arrays. One simple small-angle grain 
boundary is formed when edge dislocations are aligned in the manner of Figure 4.8. 
This type is called a tilt boundary; the angle of misorientation, 9, is also indicated in 
the figure. When the angle of misorientation is parallel to the boundary, a twist bound¬ 
ary results, which can be described by an array of screw dislocations. 

The atoms are bonded less regularly along a grain boundary (e.g., bond angles 
are longer), and consequently, there is an interfacial or grain boundary energy sim¬ 
ilar to the surface energy just described. The magnitude of this energy is a function 
of the degree of misorientation, being larger for high-angle boundaries. Grain bound¬ 
aries are more chemically reactive than the grains themselves as a consequence of 
this boundary energy. Furthermore, impurity atoms often preferentially segregate 
along these boundaries because of their higher energy state. The total interfacial en¬ 
ergy is lower in large or coarse-grained materials than in fine-grained ones, because 
there is less total boundary area in the former. Grains grow at elevated tempera¬ 
tures to reduce the total boundary energy, a phenomenon explained in Section 7.13. 

In spite of this disordered arrangement of atoms and lack of regular bonding 
along grain boundaries, a polycrystalline material is still very strong; cohesive forces

within and across the boundary are present. Furthermore, the density of a polycrys¬ 
talline specimen is virtually identical to that of a single crystal of the same material. 

Phase Boundaries 

Phase boundaries exist in multiphase materials (Section 9.3), wherein a different 
phase exists on each side of the boundary; furthermore, each of the constituent phases 
has its own distinctive physical and/or chemical characteristics. As we shall see in 
subsequent chapters, phase boundaries play an important role in determining the 
mechanical characteristics of some multiphase metal alloys. 

Twin Boundaries 

A twin boundary is a special type of grain boundary across which there is a specific 
mirror lattice symmetry; that is, atoms on one side of the boundary are located in 
mirror-image positions of the atoms on the other side (Figure 4.9). The region of

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Catalysts (and Surface Defects) 


A catalyst is a substance that speeds up the rate 
of a chemical reaction without participating 
in the reaction itself (i.e., it is not consumed). One 
type of catalyst exists as a solid; reactant molecules 
in a gas or liquid phase are adsorbed 5 onto the cat¬ 
alytic surface, at which point some type of inter¬ 
action occurs that promotes an increase in their 
chemical reactivity rate. 

Adsorption sites on a catalyst are normally 
surface defects associated with planes of atoms; an 
interatomic/intermolecular bond is formed be¬ 
tween a defect site and an adsorbed molecular 
species. Several types of surface defects, repre¬ 
sented schematically in Figure 4.10, include ledges, 
kinks, terraces, vacancies, and individual adatoms 
(i.e., atoms adsorbed on the surface). 

One important use of catalysts is in catalytic 
converters on automobiles, which reduce the emis¬ 
sion of exhaust gas pollutants such as carbon 
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO*, where % is 
variable), and unburned hydrocarbons. (See the 
chapter-opening diagrams and photograph for 
this chapter.) Air is introduced into the exhaust 
emissions from the automobile engine; this mix¬ 
ture of gases then passes over the catalyst, which 
adsorbs on its surface molecules of CO, NO*, and 
0 2 . The NO* dissociates into N and O atoms, 
whereas the 0 2 dissociates into its atomic species. 
Pairs of nitrogen atoms combine to form N 2 mol¬ 
ecules, and carbon monoxide is oxidized to form

defects that are potential adsorption sites for catalysis. 
Individual atom sites are represented as cubes. 


carbon dioxide (C0 2 ). Furthermore, any unburned 
hydrocarbons are also oxidized to C0 2 and H 2 0. 

One of the materials used as a catalyst in this 
application is (Ce 05 Zr 05 )O 2 . Figure 4.11 is a high- 
resolution transmission electron micrograph that 
shows several single crystals of this material. Indi¬ 
vidual atoms are resolved in this micrograph as well 
as some of the defects presented in Figure 4.10. 
These surface defects act as adsorption sites for the 
atomic and molecular species noted in the previous 
paragraph. Consequently, dissociation, combina¬ 
tion, and oxidation reactions involving these species 
are facilitated, such that the content of pollutant 
species (CO, NO*, and unburned hydrocarbons) in 
the exhaust gas stream is reduced significantly.

material between these boundaries is appropriately termed a twin. Twins result from 
atomic displacements that are produced from applied mechanical shear forces (me¬ 
chanical twins), and also during annealing heat treatments following deformation 
(annealing twins). Twinning occurs on a definite crystallographic plane and in a spe¬ 
cific direction, both of which depend on the crystal structure. Annealing twins are 
typically found in metals that have the FCC crystal structure, whereas mechanical 
twins are observed in BCC and HCP metals. The role of mechanical twins in the 
deformation process is discussed in Section 7.7. Annealing twins may be observed 
in the photomicrograph of the polycrystalline brass specimen shown in Figure 4.13c. 
The twins correspond to those regions having relatively straight and parallel sides 
and a different visual contrast than the untwinned regions of the grains within which 
they reside. An explanation for the variety of textural contrasts in this photomi¬ 
crograph is provided in Section 4.10. 

Miscellaneous Interfacial Defects 

Other possible interfacial defects include stacking faults and ferromagnetic domain 
walls. Stacking faults are found in FCC metals when there is an interruption in the 
ABCABCABC ... stacking sequence of close-packed planes (Section 3.12). For fer¬ 
romagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, the boundary that separates regions hav¬ 
ing different directions of magnetization is termed a domain wall, which is discussed 
in Section 20.7. 

Associated with each of the defects discussed in this section is an interfacial en¬ 
ergy, the magnitude of which depends on boundary type, and which will vary from 
material to material. Normally, the interfacial energy will be greatest for external 
surfaces and least for domain walls. 

^ Concept Check 4.1 

The surface energy of a single crystal depends on crystallographic orientation. Does 
this surface energy increase or decrease with an increase in planar density? Why? 

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


4.7 BULK OR VOLUME DEFECTS 

Other defects exist in all solid materials that are much larger than those heretofore 
discussed. These include pores, cracks, foreign inclusions, and other phases. They are 
normally introduced during processing and fabrication steps. Some of these defects 
and their effects on the properties of materials are discussed in subsequent chapters. 

4.8 ATOMIC VIBRATIONS 

Every atom in a solid material is vibrating very rapidly about its lattice position 
atomic vibration within the crystal. In a sense, these atomic vibrations may be thought of as imper¬ 

fections or defects. At any instant of time not all atoms vibrate at the same fre¬ 
quency and amplitude, nor with the same energy. At a given temperature there will 
exist a distribution of energies for the constituent atoms about an average energy. 
Over time the vibrational energy of any specific atom will also vary in a random 
manner. With rising temperature, this average energy increases, and, in fact, the tem¬ 
perature of a solid is really just a measure of the average vibrational activity of 
atoms and molecules. At room temperature, a typical vibrational frequency is on 





4.9 Basic Concepts Of Microscopy * 107 


the order of 10 13 vibrations per second, whereas the amplitude is a few thousandths 
of a nanometer. 

Many properties and processes in solids are manifestations of this vibrational 
atomic motion. For example, melting occurs when the vibrations are vigorous 
enough to rupture large numbers of atomic bonds. A more detailed discussion of 
atomic vibrations and their influence on the properties of materials is presented in 
Chapter 19. 

Microscopic Examination 

4.9 BASIC CONCEPTS OF MICROSCOPY 

On occasion it is necessary or desirable to examine the structural elements and de¬ 
fects that influence the properties of materials. Some structural elements are of 
macroscopic dimensions; that is, they are large enough to be observed with the un¬ 
aided eye. For example, the shape and average size or diameter of the grains for a 
polycrystalline specimen are important structural characteristics. Macroscopic 
grains are often evident on aluminum streetlight posts and also on highway 
guardrails. Relatively large grains having different textures are clearly visible on the 
surface of the sectioned copper ingot shown in Figure 4.12. However, in most 
materials the constituent grains are of microscopic dimensions, having diameters 
that may be on the order of microns, 6 and their details must be investigated using some

type of microscope. Grain size and shape are only two features of what is termed 
the microstructure; these and other microstructural characteristics are discussed in 
subsequent chapters. 

Optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopes are commonly used in 
microscopy. These instruments aid in investigations of the microstructural features 
of all material types. Some of these techniques employ photographic equipment in 
conjunction with the microscope; the photograph on which the image is recorded 
is called a photomicrograph. In addition, many microstructural images are com¬ 
puter generated and/or enhanced. 

Microscopic examination is an extremely useful tool in the study and character¬ 
ization of materials. Several important applications of microstructural examinations 
are as follows: to ensure that the associations between the properties and structure 
(and defects) are properly understood, to predict the properties of materials once 
these relationships have been established, to design alloys with new property com¬ 
binations, to determine whether a material has been correctly heat-treated, and to 
ascertain the mode of mechanical fracture. Several techniques that are commonly 
used in such investigations are discussed next. 

4.10 MICROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES 

Optical Microscopy 

With optical microscopy, the light microscope is used to study the microstructure; 
optical and illumination systems are its basic elements. For materials that are opaque 
to visible light (all metals and many ceramics and polymers), only the surface is 
subject to observation, and the light microscope must be used in a reflecting mode. 
Contrasts in the image produced result from differences in reflectivity of the vari¬ 
ous regions of the microstructure. Investigations of this type are often termed met- 
allographic, because metals were first examined using this technique. 

Normally, careful and meticulous surface preparations are necessary to reveal 
the important details of the microstructure. The specimen surface must first be 
ground and polished to a smooth and mirrorlike finish. This is accomplished by us¬ 
ing successively finer abrasive papers and powders. The microstructure is revealed 
by a surface treatment using an appropriate chemical reagent in a procedure termed 
etching . The chemical reactivity of the grains of some single-phase materials de¬ 
pends on crystallographic orientation. Consequently, in a polycrystalline specimen, 
etching characteristics vary from grain to grain. Figure 4.13 b shows how normally 
incident light is reflected by three etched surface grains, each having a different ori¬ 
entation. Figure 4.13a depicts the surface structure as it might appear when viewed 
with the microscope; the luster or texture of each grain depends on its reflectance 
properties. A photomicrograph of a polycrystalline specimen exhibiting these char¬ 
acteristics is shown in Figure 4.13c. 

Also, small grooves form along grain boundaries as a consequence of etching. 
Because atoms along grain boundary regions are more chemically active, they 
dissolve at a greater rate than those within the grains. These grooves become dis¬ 
cernible when viewed under a microscope because they reflect light at an angle dif¬ 
ferent from that of the grains themselves; this effect is displayed in Figure 4.14a. 
Figure 4.14 b is a photomicrograph of a polycrystalline specimen in which the grain 
boundary grooves are clearly visible as dark lines. 

When the microstructure of a two-phase alloy is to be examined, an etchant is 
often chosen that produces a different texture for each phase so that the different 
phases may be distinguished from each other.

Electron Microscopy 

The upper limit to the magnification possible with an optical microscope is ap¬ 
proximately 2000 times. Consequently, some structural elements are too fine or small 
to permit observation using optical microscopy. Under such circumstances the elec¬ 
tron microscope, which is capable of much higher magnifications, may be employed. 

An image of the structure under investigation is formed using beams of elec¬ 
trons instead of light radiation. According to quantum mechanics, a high-velocity

electron will become wavelike, having a wavelength that is inversely proportional 
to its velocity. When accelerated across large voltages, electrons can be made to 
have wavelengths on the order of 0.003 nm (3 pm). High magnifications and re¬ 
solving powers of these microscopes are consequences of the short wavelengths of 
electron beams. The electron beam is focused and the image formed with magnetic 
lenses; otherwise the geometry of the microscope components is essentially the same 
as with optical systems. Both transmission and reflection beam modes of operation 
are possible for electron microscopes. 

Transmission Electron Microscopy 

The image seen with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) is formed by an 
electron beam that passes through the specimen. Details of internal microstructural 
features are accessible to observation; contrasts in the image are produced by

differences in beam scattering or diffraction produced between various elements of 
the microstructure or defect. Because solid materials are highly absorptive to elec¬ 
tron beams, a specimen to be examined must be prepared in the form of a very thin 
foil; this ensures transmission through the specimen of an appreciable fraction of 
the incident beam. The transmitted beam is projected onto a fluorescent screen or 
a photographic film so that the image may be viewed. Magnifications approaching 
1,000,000X are possible with transmission electron microscopy, which is frequently 
used to study dislocations. 

Scanning Electron Microscopy 

A more recent and extremely useful investigative tool is the scanning electron mi¬ 
croscope (SEM). The surface of a specimen to be examined is scanned with an elec¬ 
tron beam, and the reflected (or back-scattered) beam of electrons is collected, then 
displayed at the same scanning rate on a cathode ray tube (similar to a CRT tele¬ 
vision screen). The image on the screen, which may be photographed, represents 
the surface features of the specimen. The surface may or may not be polished and 
etched, but it must be electrically conductive; a very thin metallic surface coating 
must be applied to nonconductive materials. Magnifications ranging from 10 to in 
excess of 50,000 times are possible, as are also very great depths of field. Accessory 
equipment permits qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of the elemental com¬ 
position of very localized surface areas. 

Scanning Probe Microscopy 

In the past decade and a half, the field of microscopy has experienced a revolution 
with the development of a new family of scanning probe microscopes. The scanning 
probe microscope (SPM), of which there are several varieties, differs from optical 
and electron microscopes in that neither light nor electrons are used to form an im¬ 
age. Rather, the microscope generates a topographical map, on an atomic scale, that 
is a representation of surface features and characteristics of the specimen being ex¬ 
amined. Some of the features that differentiate the SPM from other microscopic 
techniques are as follows: 

• Examination on the nanometer scale is possible inasmuch as magnifications 
as high as 10 9 X are possible; much better resolutions are attainable than with 
other microscopic techniques. 

• Three-dimensional magnified images are generated that provide topographi¬ 
cal information about features of interest. 

• Some SPMs may be operated in a variety of environments (e.g., vacuum, air, 
liquid); thus, a particular specimen may be examined in its most suitable envi¬ 
ronment. 

Scanning probe microscopes employ a tiny probe with a very sharp tip that is 
brought into very close proximity (i.e., to within on the order of a nanometer) of 
the specimen surface. This probe is then raster-scanned across the plane of the sur¬ 
face. During scanning, the probe experiences deflections perpendicular to this 
plane, in response to electronic or other interactions between the probe and spec¬ 
imen surface. The in-surface-plane and out-of-plane motions of the probe are con¬ 
trolled by piezoelectric (Section 18.25) ceramic components that have nanometer 
resolutions. Furthermore, these probe movements are monitored electronically 
and transferred to and stored in a computer, which then generates the three- 
dimensional surface image. 


112 * Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids 

These new SPMs, which allow examination of the surface of materials at the 
atomic and molecular level, have provided a wealth of information about a host of 
materials, from integrated circuit chips to biological molecules. Indeed, the advent 
of the SPMs has helped to usher in the era of nanomaterials—materials whose prop¬ 
erties are designed by engineering atomic and molecular structures. 

Figure 4.15a is a bar chart showing dimensional size ranges for several types of 
structures found in materials (note that the axes are scaled logarithmically). Like¬ 
wise, the useful dimensional resolution ranges for the several microscopic techniques 
discussed in this chapter (plus the naked eye) are presented in the bar chart of Fig¬ 
ure 4.15Z?. For three of these techniques (SPM, TEM, and SEM), an upper resolu¬ 
tion value is not imposed by the characteristics of the microscope, and, therefore, 
is somewhat arbitrary and not well defined. Furthermore, by comparing Figures 
4.15a and 4.15Z?, it is possible to decide which microscopic technique(s) is (are) best 
suited for examination of each of the structure types.

4.11 GRAIN SIZE DETERMINATION 


grain size 


Relationship 
between ASTM 
grain size number 
and number of 
grains per square 
inch (at 100 X) 


The grain size is often determined when the properties of a polycrystalline mate¬ 
rial are under consideration. In this regard, there exist a number of techniques by 
which size is specified in terms of average grain volume, diameter, or area. Grain 
size may be estimated by using an intercept method, described as follows. Straight 
lines all the same length are drawn through several photomicrographs that show 
the grain structure. The grains intersected by each line segment are counted; the 
line length is then divided by an average of the number of grains intersected, taken 
over all the line segments. The average grain diameter is found by dividing this re¬ 
sult by the linear magnification of the photomicrographs. 

Probably the most common method, however, is that devised by the Amer¬ 
ican Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). 7 The ASTM has prepared sev¬ 
eral standard comparison charts, all having different average grain sizes. To each 
is assigned a number ranging from 1 to 10, which is termed the grain size num¬ 
ber. A specimen must be properly prepared to reveal the grain structure, which 
is photographed at a magnification of 100X. Grain size is expressed as the grain 
size number of the chart that most nearly matches the grains in the micrograph. 
Thus, a relatively simple and convenient visual determination of grain size num¬ 
ber is possible. Grain size number is used extensively in the specification of 
steels. 

The rationale behind the assignment of the grain size number to these various 
charts is as follows. Let n represent the grain size number, and N the average num¬ 
ber of grains per square inch at a magnification of 100X. These two parameters are 
related to each other through the expression 

N = 2 n ~ l (4.16) 



Check 


4.2 


Does the grain size number (n of Equation 4.16) increase or decrease with 
decreasing grain size? Why? 


[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 4.4 

Computations of ASTM Grain Size Number and Number of 
Grains per Unit Area 

(a) Determine the ASTM grain size number of a metal specimen if 45 grains 
per square inch are measured at a magnification of 100X. 

(b) For this same specimen, how many grains per square inch will there be at 
a magnification of 85 X? 

Solution 

(a) In order to determine the ASTM grain size number ( n ) it is necessary 
to employ Equation 4.16. Taking logarithms of both sides of this expression 
leads to 


7 ASTM Standard E 112, “Standard Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size.'

Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids 


Solving for n yields 


log/V = (n — l)log2 


log N , . 

n = 1—;r + 1 
log 2 

From the problem statement, N = A5, and therefore 

log 45 


log 2 


+ 1 = 6.5 


(b) At magnifications other than 100X, use of the following modified form of 
Equation 4.16 is necessary: 


N m 



= 2 n 


(4.17) 


In this expression N M = the number of grains per square inch at magnifica¬ 
tion M. In addition, the inclusion of the (M/100) 2 term makes use of the fact 
that, while magnification is a length parameter, area is expressed in terms of 
units of length squared. As a consequence, the number of grains per unit area 
increases with the square of the increase in magnification. 

Solving Equation 4.17 for N M , realizing that M = 85 and n = 6.5, leads to 


N t 


M 


= = 62.6 grains/in. 2 


SUMMARY 


Vacancies and Self-Interstitials 

• Point defects are those associated with one or two atomic positions; these include 
vacancies (or vacant lattice sites) and self-interstitials (host atoms that occupy 
interstitial sites). 

• The equilibrium number of vacancies depends on temperature according to 
Equation 4.1. 

Impurities in Solids 

• An alloy is a metallic substance that is composed of two or more elements. 

• A solid solution may form when impurity atoms are added to a solid, in which 
case the original crystal structure is retained and no new phases are formed. 

• For substitutional solid solutions, impurity atoms substitute for host atoms. 

• Interstitial solid solutions form for relatively small impurity atoms that occupy 
interstitial sites among the host atoms. 

• For substitutional solid solutions, appreciable solubility is possible only when 
atomic diameters and electronegativities for both atom types are similar, when 
both elements have the same crystal structure, and when the impurity atoms have 
a valence that is the same as or less than the host material. 







Summary * 115 


Specification of Composition 

• Composition of an alloy may be specified in weight percent (on the basis of mass 
fraction, Equation 4.3) or atom percent (on the basis of mole or atom fraction, 
Equation 4.5). 

• Expressions were provided that allow conversion of weight percent to atom per¬ 
cent (Equation 4.6a) and vice versa (Equation 4.7a). 

• Computation of average density and average atomic weight for a two-phase alloy 
are possible using other equations cited in this chapter (Equations 4.10a, 4.10b, 
4.11a, and 4.11b). 

Dislocations—Linear Defects 

• Dislocations are one-dimensional crystalline defects of which there are two pure 
types: edge and screw. 

An edge may be thought of in terms of the lattice distortion along the end of 
an extra half-plane of atoms. 

A screw is as a helical planar ramp. 

For mixed dislocations, components of both pure edge and screw are found. 

• The magnitude and direction of lattice distortion associated with a dislocation 
are specified by its Burgers vector. 

• The relative orientations of Burgers vector and dislocation line are (1) perpen¬ 
dicular for edge, (2) parallel for screw, and (3) neither perpendicular nor parallel 
for mixed. 

Interfacial Defects 

• Within the vicinity of a grain boundary (which is several atomic distances wide), 
there is some atomic mismatch between two adjacent grains that have different 
crystallographic orientations. 

• For a high-angle grain boundary, the angle of misalignment between grains is rel¬ 
atively large; this angle is relatively small for small-angle grain boundaries. 

• Across a twin boundary, atoms on one side reside in mirror-image positions of 
atoms on the other side. 

Microscopic Techniques 

• The microstructure of a material consists of defects and structural elements that 
are of microscopic dimensions. Microscopy is the observation of microstructure 
using some type of microscope. 

• Both optical and electron microscopes are employed, usually in conjunction with 
photographic equipment. 

• Transmissive and reflective modes are possible for each microscope type; pref¬ 
erence is dictated by the nature of the specimen as well as the structural element 
or defect to be examined. 

• In order to observe the grain structure of a polycrystalline material using an op¬ 
tical microscope, the specimen surface must be ground and polished in order to 
produce a very smooth and mirrorlike finish. Some type of chemical reagent (or 
etchant) must then be applied in order to either reveal the grain boundaries or 
produce a variety of light reflectance characteristics for the constituent grains. 

• The two types of electron microscopes are transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM). 

For TEM an image is formed from an electron beam that, while passing 
through the specimen, is scattered and/or diffracted. 

SEM employs an electron beam that raster-scans the specimen surface; an 
image is produced from back-scattered or reflected electrons. 


116 * Chapter 4 / Imperfections in Solids 

• A scanning probe microscope employs a small and sharp-tipped probe that raster- 
scans the specimen surface. Out-of-plane deflections of the probe result from 
interactions with surface atoms. A computer-generated and three-dimensional 
image of the surface results having nanometer resolution. 

Grain Size Determination 

• With the intercept method, used to measure grain size, a series of straight-line 
segments (all having the same length) are drawn on a photomicrograph. Line 
length is divided by the average number of grain intersections on a per-line basis. 
Average grain diameter is taken as this result divided by the magnification of the 
photomicrograph. 

• Comparison of a photomicrograph (taken at a magnification of 100 X) with ASTM 
standard comparison charts may be used to specify grain size in terms of a grain 
size number. 

• The average number of grains per square inch at a magnification of 100 X is related 
to grain size number according to Equation 4.16.

In this chapter we discussed several schemes used to specify concentration of one 
element in another; equations were also provided to convert from one scheme to an¬ 
other. During the processing of silicon to form integrated circuit components (Chap¬ 
ters 5 and 18), it is imperative that specification and control of impurity concentration 
be extremely precise. These relationships are represented in the following diagram:

The concept of a solid solution was also discussed. One form of solid solution 
in an iron-carbon alloy, or steel (martensite), derives its high strength and hardness 
from the formation of an interstitial solid solution (carbon dissolved in iron). The 
following diagram represents this relationship:

With a knowledge of the characteristics of dislocation defects, we are able to

manently deform (Chapter 7), and, in addition, techniques that are used to improve 
the mechanical properties of these materials. The following diagram notes this

4.5 For both FCC and BCC crystal structures, 
there are two different types of interstitial 
sites. In each case, one site is larger than the 
other and is normally occupied by impurity 
atoms. For FCC, this larger one is located at 
the center of each edge of the unit cell; it is 
termed an octahedral interstitial site. On the 
other hand, with BCC the larger site type is 
found at 0 \ ^positions—that is,lying on {100} 
faces and situated midway between two unit 
cell edges on this face and one-quarter of the 
distance between the other two unit cell 
edges; it is termed a tetrahedral interstitial site. 
For both FCC and BCC crystal structures, 
compute the radius r of an impurity atom that 
will just fit into one of these sites in terms of 
the atomic radius R of the host atom.

The photograph at the top of this page is of a steel gear that has 
been case hardened. Its outer surface layer was selectively hardened 
by a high-temperature heat treatment during which carbon from the 
surrounding atmosphere diffused into the surface. The "case" appears 
as the dark outer rim of that segment of the gear that has been sec¬ 
tioned. This increase in the carbon content raises the surface hardness 
(as explained in Section 10.7), which in turn leads to an improvement 
of wear resistance of the gear. In addition, residual compressive 
stresses are introduced within the case region; these give rise to an 
enhancement of the gear's resistance to failure by fatigue while in 
service (Chapter 8). 

Case-hardened steel gears are used in automobile transmissions, 
similar to the one shown in the photograph directly below the gear.

Materials of all types are often heat-treated to im¬ 
prove their properties. The phenomena that occur 
during a heat treatment almost always involve atomic 
diffusion. Often an enhancement of diffusion rate is 
desired; on occasion measures are taken to reduce it. 
Heat-treating temperatures and times and/or cooling 
rates are often predictable using the mathematics of 
diffusion and appropriate diffusion constants. The steel 
gear shown on page 122 (top) has been case hardened 
(Section 8.10); that is, its hardness and resistance to 
failure by fatigue have been enhanced by diffusing excess 
carbon or nitrogen into the outer surface layer. 


In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying diffusion are as follows: 

• Diffusional processes (conducted at elevated tem¬ 
peratures) are often utilized to introduce impurity 
atoms into silicon semiconductors. Thus, a knowl¬ 
edge of the time and temperature dependences of 
appropriate diffusion parameters is necessary. 

• Likewise, the heat treatment of steels (and the 
development of their mechanical properties) 
involves diffusion.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 

Many reactions and processes that are important in the treatment of materials rely 
on the transfer of mass either within a specific solid (ordinarily on a microscopic 
level) or from a liquid, a gas, or another solid phase. This is necessarily accomplished 
diffusion by diffusion, the phenomenon of material transport by atomic motion. This chap¬ 

ter discusses the atomic mechanisms by which diffusion occurs, the mathematics of 
diffusion, and the influence of temperature and diffusing species on the rate of 
diffusion. 

The phenomenon of diffusion may be demonstrated with the use of a diffu¬ 
sion couple , which is formed by joining bars of two different metals together so 
that there is intimate contact between the two faces; this is illustrated for copper 
and nickel in Figure 5.1, which includes schematic representations of atom posi¬ 
tions and composition across the interface. This couple is heated for an extended 
period at an elevated temperature (but below the melting temperature of both 
metals) and cooled to room temperature. Chemical analysis will reveal a condition 
similar to that represented in Figure 5.2—namely, pure copper and nickel at the 
two extremities of the couple, separated by an alloyed region. Concentrations of

both metals vary with position as shown in Figure 5.2c. This result indicates that 
copper atoms have migrated or diffused into the nickel, and that nickel has dif¬ 
fused into copper. This process, whereby atoms of one metal diffuse into another, 
is termed interdiffusion, or impurity diffusion.

5.2 Diffusion Mechanisms * 125 


Interdiffusion may be discerned from a macroscopic perspective by changes in 
concentration that occur over time, as in the example for the Cu-Ni diffusion cou¬ 
ple. There is a net drift or transport of atoms from high- to low-concentration regions. 
Diffusion also occurs for pure metals, but all atoms exchanging positions are of the 
self-diffusion same type; this is termed self-diffusion. Of course, self-diffusion is not normally sub¬ 

ject to observation by noting compositional changes. 


5.2 DIFFUSION MECHANISMS 

From an atomic perspective, diffusion is just the stepwise migration of atoms from 
lattice site to lattice site. In fact, the atoms in solid materials are in constant motion, 
rapidly changing positions. For an atom to make such a move, two conditions must 
be met: (1) there must be an empty adjacent site, and (2) the atom must have suf¬ 
ficient energy to break bonds with its neighbor atoms and then cause some lattice 
distortion during the displacement.This energy is vibrational in nature (Section 4.8). 
At a specific temperature some small fraction of the total number of atoms is 
capable of diffusive motion, by virtue of the magnitudes of their vibrational ener¬ 
gies. This fraction increases with rising temperature. 

Several different models for this atomic motion have been proposed; of these 
possibilities, two dominate for metallic diffusion. 

Vacancy Diffusion 

One mechanism involves the interchange of an atom from a normal lattice position 
to an adjacent vacant lattice site or vacancy, as represented schematically in Figure 
vacancy diffusion 5.3a. This mechanism is aptly termed vacancy diffusion. Of course, this process ne¬ 
cessitates the presence of vacancies, and the extent to which vacancy diffusion can 
occur is a function of the number of these defects that are present; significant

126 * Chapter 5 / Diffusion 

concentrations of vacancies may exist in metals at elevated temperatures (Section 
4.2). Because diffusing atoms and vacancies exchange positions, the diffusion of 
atoms in one direction corresponds to the motion of vacancies in the opposite di¬ 
rection. Both self-diffusion and interdiffusion occur by this mechanism; for the lat¬ 
ter, the impurity atoms must substitute for host atoms. 

Interstitial Diffusion 

The second type of diffusion involves atoms that migrate from an interstitial po¬ 
sition to a neighboring one that is empty. This mechanism is found for interdif¬ 
fusion of impurities such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, which have 
atoms that are small enough to fit into the interstitial positions. Host or substi¬ 
tutional impurity atoms rarely form interstitials and do not normally diffuse via 
interstitial diffusion this mechanism. This phenomenon is appropriately termed interstitial diffusion 
(Figure 5.3 b). 

In most metal alloys, interstitial diffusion occurs much more rapidly than dif¬ 
fusion by the vacancy mode, because the interstitial atoms are smaller and thus 
more mobile. Furthermore, there are more empty interstitial positions than vacan¬ 
cies; hence, the probability of interstitial atomic movement is greater than for 
vacancy diffusion. 


5.3 STEADY-STATE DIFFUSION 

Diffusion is a time-dependent process—that is, in a macroscopic sense, the quan¬ 
tity of an element that is transported within another is a function of time. Often it 
is necessary to know how fast diffusion occurs, or the rate of mass transfer. This 
diffusion flux rate is frequently expressed as a diffusion flux (/), defined as the mass (or, equiv¬ 

alently, the number of atoms) M diffusing through and perpendicular to a unit 
cross-sectional area of solid per unit of time. In mathematical form, this may be 
represented as

diffusion time. In differential form, this expression becomes

gradient 


The units for J are kilograms or atoms per meter squared per second (kg/m 2 - s or 
atoms/m 2 - s). 

If the diffusion flux does not change with time, a steady-state condition exists. 
One common example of steady-state diffusion is the diffusion of atoms of a gas 
through a plate of metal for which the concentrations (or pressures) of the diffus¬ 
ing species on both surfaces of the plate are held constant. This is represented 
schematically in Figure 5.4a. 

When concentration C is plotted versus position (or distance) within the solid x, 
the resulting curve is termed the concentration profile; the slope at a particular 
point on this curve is the concentration gradient:

For diffusion problems, it is sometimes convenient to express concentration in terms 
of mass of diffusing species per unit volume of solid (kg/m 3 or g/cm 3 ). 1 

The mathematics of steady-state diffusion in a single (x) direction is relatively 
simple, in that the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient through the 
expression 


^ dC 
D dx 


(5.3) 


The constant of proportionality D is called the diffusion coefficient, which is ex¬ 
pressed in square meters per second. The negative sign in this expression indicates 
that the direction of diffusion is down the concentration gradient, from a high to a 
low concentration. Equation 5.3 is sometimes called Fick’s first law. 

Sometimes the term driving force is used in the context of what compels a re¬ 
action to occur. For diffusion reactions, several such forces are possible; but when 
diffusion is according to Equation 5.3, the concentration gradient is the driving force. 

One practical example of steady-state diffusion is found in the purification of 
hydrogen gas. One side of a thin sheet of palladium metal is exposed to the impure 
gas composed of hydrogen and other gaseous species such as nitrogen, oxygen, and 
water vapor. The hydrogen selectively diffuses through the sheet to the opposite 
side, which is maintained at a constant and lower hydrogen pressure. 


1 Conversion of concentration from weight percent to mass per unit volume (in kg/m 3 ) is 
possible using Equation 4.9.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.1 


Diffusion Flux Computation 

A plate of iron is exposed to a carburizing (carbon-rich) atmosphere on one 
side and a decarburizing (carbon-deficient) atmosphere on the other side at 
700°C (1300°F). If a condition of steady state is achieved, calculate the diffu¬ 
sion flux of carbon through the plate if the concentrations of carbon at 
positions of 5 and 10 mm (5 X 1CT 3 and 1CT 2 m) beneath the carburizing sur¬ 
face are 1.2 and 0.8 kg/m 3 , respectively. Assume a diffusion coefficient of 3 X 
1CT 11 m 2 /s at this temperature. 


Solution 

Fick’s first law, Equation 5.3, is utilized to determine the diffusion flux. Sub¬ 
stitution of the values above into this expression yields

5.4 NONSTEADY-STATE DIFFUSION 


Most practical diffusion situations are nonsteady-state ones. That is, the diffusion 
flux and the concentration gradient at some particular point in a solid vary with 
time, with a net accumulation or depletion of the diffusing species resulting. This is 
illustrated in Figure 5.5, which shows concentration profiles at three different dif¬ 
fusion times. Under conditions of nonsteady state, use of Equation 5.3 is no longer 
convenient; instead, the partial differential equation

Solution to Fick’s 
second law for the 
condition of constant 
surface concentra¬ 
tion (for a semi¬ 
infinite solid) 


Comprehensive collections of these are given by Crank, and Carslaw and Jaeger 
(see References). 

One practically important solution is for a semi-infinite solid 2 in which the sur¬ 
face concentration is held constant. Frequently, the source of the diffusing species 
is a gas phase, the partial pressure of which is maintained at a constant value. Fur¬ 
thermore, the following assumptions are made: 

1. Before diffusion, any of the diffusing solute atoms in the solid are uniformly 

distributed with concentration of C 0 . 

2. The value of x at the surface is zero and increases with distance into the solid. 

3. The time is taken to be zero the instant before the diffusion process begins. 

These boundary conditions are simply stated as 
For t = 0, C = C 0 at 0 < x < o° 

For t > 0, C = C s (the constant surface concentration) at x = 0 
C = C 0 at x = oo 

Application of these boundary conditions to Equation 5.4b yields the solution 

c, - c 0 ° = 1 “ erf (2^) (5 - 5) 

where C x represents the concentration at depth x after time t. The expression 
erf(x/2 \/ r Dt) is the Gaussian error function, 3 values of which are given in mathe¬ 
matical tables for various x/2 \TDt values; a partial listing is given in Table 5.1. The

Figure 5.6 Concentration profile for 
nonsteady-state diffusion; concentration 
parameters relate to Equation 5.5. 



concentration parameters that appear in Equation 5.5 are noted in Figure 5.6, a 
concentration profile taken at a specific time. Equation 5.5 thus demonstrates the 
relationship between concentration, position, and time—namely, that C x , being a 
function of the dimensionless parameter x/VZ5f, may be determined at any time 
and position if the parameters C 0 , C s , and D are known. 

Suppose that it is desired to achieve some specific concentration of solute, C l5 
in an alloy; the left-hand side of Equation 5.5 now becomes 

q - c 0 

—-—- = constant

This being the case, the right-hand side of this same expression is also a constant, 
and subsequently

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.2 


Nonsteady-State Diffusion Time Computation I 

For some applications, it is necessary to harden the surface of a steel (or 
iron-carbon alloy) above that of its interior. One way this may be accom¬ 
plished is by increasing the surface concentration of carbon in a process termed 
carburizing; the steel piece is exposed, at an elevated temperature, to an at¬ 
mosphere rich in a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane (CH 4 ). 

Consider one such alloy that initially has a uniform carbon concentration 
of 0.25 wt% and is to be treated at 950°C (1750°F). If the concentration of 
carbon at the surface is suddenly brought to and maintained at 1.20 wt%, how 
long will it take to achieve a carbon content of 0.80 wt% at a position 0.5 mm 
below the surface? The diffusion coefficient for carbon in iron at this tem¬ 
perature is 1.6 X 10 -11 m 2 /s; assume that the steel piece is semi-infinite. 













5.4 Nonsteady-State Diffusion * 131 


Solution 

Because this is a nonsteady-state diffusion problem in which the surface com¬ 
position is held constant, Equation 5.5 is used. Values for all the parameters 
in this expression except time t are specified in the problem as follows: 


Thus, 


Q- Cp

C 0 = 0.25 wt% C

Nonsteady-State Diffusion Time Computation II 

The diffusion coefficients for copper in aluminum at 500 and 600°C are 4.8 X 
10 -14 and 5.3 X 10 13 m 2 /s, respectively. Determine the approximate time at 
500°C that will produce the same diffusion result (in terms of concentration 
of Cu at some specific point in Al) as a 10-h heat treatment at 600°C. 

Solution 

This is a diffusion problem in which Equation 5.6b may be employed. The 
composition in both diffusion situations will be equal at the same position (i.e., 
x is also a constant), thus

5.5 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE DIFFUSION 

Diffusing Species 

The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient D is indicative of the rate at which atoms 
diffuse. Coefficients, both self- and interdiffusion, for several metallic systems are 
listed in Table 5.2. The diffusing species as well as the host material influence the 
diffusion coefficient. For example, there is a significant difference in magnitude between 
self-diffusion and carbon interdiffusion in a iron at 500°C, the D value being greater 
for the carbon interdiffusion (3.0 X 10“ 21 vs. 2.4 X 10 12 m 2 /s).This comparison also 
provides a contrast between rates of diffusion via vacancy and interstitial modes as 
discussed earlier. Self-diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism, whereas carbon dif¬ 
fusion in iron is interstitial. 

Temperature 

Temperature has a most profound influence on the coefficients and diffusion rates. 
For example, for the self-diffusion of Fe in a- Fe, the diffusion coefficient increases 
approximately six orders of magnitude (from 3.0 X 10 -21 to 1.8 X 10 -15 m 2 /s) in ris¬ 
ing temperature from 500°C to 900°C (Table 5.2). The temperature dependence of

Dependence of the / Q d \

where 

D 0 = a temperature-independent preexponential (m 2 /s) 
activation energy Q d = the activation energy for diffusion (J/mol or eV/atom) 

R = the gas constant, 8.31 J/mol-K or 8.62 X 10 -5 eV/atom-K 
T = absolute temperature (K) 

The activation energy may be thought of as that energy required to produce 
the diffusive motion of one mole of atoms. A large activation energy results in a 
relatively small diffusion coefficient. Table 5.2 also contains a listing of D 0 and Q d 
values for several diffusion systems. 

Taking natural logarithms of Equation 5.8 yields 

In D = lnD 0 - (5.9a) 

or, in terms of logarithms to the base 10, 

log D = log£> 0 - ( 5 - 9b ) 

Because D 0 , Q d , and R are all constants, Equation 5.9b takes on the form of an 
equation of a straight line: 

y = b + mx 

where y and x are analogous, respectively, to the variables log D and 1 IT. Thus, if 
log D is plotted versus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature, a straight line 
should result, having slope and intercept of - Q d l23R and log D 0 , respectively. This 
is, in fact, the manner in which the values of Q d and D 0 are determined experi¬ 
mentally. From such a plot for several alloy systems (Figure 5.7), it may be noted 
that linear relationships exist for all cases shown.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.4 


Diffusion Coefficient Determination 

Using the data in Table 5.2, compute the diffusion coefficient for magnesium 
in aluminum at 550°C. 


Solution 

This diffusion coefficient may be determined by applying Equation 5.8; the 
values of D 0 and Q d from Table 5.2 are 1.2 X IO -4 m 2 /s and 131 kJ/mol, re¬ 
spectively. Thus, 


D = (1.2 X 10“ 4 m 2 /s) exp

Diffusion Coefficient Activation Energy 
and Preexponential Calculations 

In Figure 5.8 is shown a plot of the logarithm (to the base 10) of the diffusion 
coefficient versus reciprocal of absolute temperature, for the diffusion of copper 
in gold. Determine values for the activation energy and the preexponential. 


Solution 

From Equation 5.9b the slope of the line segment in Figure 5.8 is equal to 
-Q d /23R, and the intercept at 1 IT = 0 gives the value of logD 0 . Thus, the 
activation energy may be determined as 


Q d = —2.3R (slope) = -2.31?

where D 1 and D 2 are the diffusion coefficient values at l/7\ and 1/T 2 , respec¬ 
tively. Let us arbitrarily take 1/7"! = 0.8 X 10 -3 (K) _1 and 1/T 2 = 1.1 X 10 -3

line segment in Figure 5.8. 

[Before this is done, however, a parenthetic note of caution is offered. The 
vertical axis in Figure 5.8 is scaled logarithmically (to the base 10); however, 
the actual diffusion coefficient values are noted on this axis. For example, for 
D = 10 -14 m 2 /s, the logarithm of D is -14.0, not 10 -14 . Furthermore, this log¬ 
arithmic scaling affects the readings between decade values; for example, at a 
location midway between 10 -14 and 10 -15 , the value is not 5 X 10 -15 but, rather, 
10“ 145 = 3.2 X 10“ 15 .]

Thus, from Figure 5.8, at 1 IT 1 = 0.8 X 10 -3 (K) _1 , log D 1 = -12.40, while 
for 1/T 2 = 1.1 X 10 -3 (K) _1 , log D 2 = -15.45, and the activation energy, as 
determined from the slope of the line segment in Figure 5.8, is

Now, rather than trying to make a graphical extrapolation to determine

specific value of D (or log D) and its corresponding T (or 1 IT) from Figure 
5.8. Because we know that log D =-15.45 at 1IT = 1.1 X 10 -3 (K) _1 , then

DESIGN EXAMPLE 5.1 


Diffusion Temperature-Time Heat Treatment Specification 

The wear resistance of a steel gear is to be improved by hardening its surface. 
This is to be accomplished by increasing the carbon content within an outer 
surface layer as a result of carbon diffusion into the steel; the carbon is to be 
supplied from an external carbon-rich gaseous atmosphere at an elevated and 
constant temperature. The initial carbon content of the steel is 0.20 wt%, 
whereas the surface concentration is to be maintained at 1.00 wt%. For this 
treatment to be effective, a carbon content of 0.60 wt% must be established at 
a position 0.75 mm below the surface. Specify an appropriate heat treatment 
in terms of temperature and time for temperatures between 900 and 1050°C. 
Use data in Table 5.2 for the diffusion of carbon in y-iron. 


Solution 

Because this is a nonsteady-state diffusion situation, let us first of all employ 
Equation 5.5, utilizing the following values for the concentration parameters: 

C 0 = 0.20 wt% C 
C s = 1.00 wt% C 
C r = 0.60 wt% C

Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient depends on temperature according to 
Equation 5.8; and, from Table 5.2 for the diffusion of carbon in y-iron, D 0 = 
2.3 X 10 -5 m 2 /s and Q d = 148,000 J/mol. Hence

5.6 DIFFUSION IN SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS 

One technology that applies solid-state diffusion is the fabrication of semiconductor 
integrated circuits (ICs) (Section 18.15). Each integrated circuit chip is a thin square 
wafer having dimensions on the order of 6 mm by 6 mm by 0.4 mm; furthermore, 


















138 * Chapter 5 / Diffusion 


millions of interconnected electronic devices and circuits are embedded in one of the 
chip faces. Single-crystal silicon is the base material for most ICs. In order for these IC 
devices to function satisfactorily, very precise concentrations of an impurity (or impu¬ 
rities) must be incorporated into minute spatial regions in a very intricate and detailed 
pattern on the silicon chip; one way this is accomplished is by atomic diffusion. 

Normally two heat treatments are used in this process. In the first, or predepo¬ 
sition step, impurity atoms are diffused into the silicon, often from a gas phase, the 
partial pressure of which is maintained constant. Thus, the surface composition of 
the impurity also remains constant over time, such that impurity concentration 
within the silicon is a function of position and time according to Equation 5.5. Pre¬ 
deposition treatments are normally carried out within the temperature range of 900 
and 1000°C and for times typically less than one hour. 

The second treatment, sometimes called drive-in diffusion, is used to transport 
impurity atoms farther into the silicon in order to provide a more suitable concen¬ 
tration distribution without increasing the overall impurity content. This treatment 
is carried out at a higher temperature than the predeposition one (up to about 
1200°C), and also in an oxidizing atmosphere so as to form an oxide layer on the 
surface. Diffusion rates through this Si0 2 layer are relatively slow, such that very 
few impurity atoms diffuse out of and escape from the silicon. Schematic concen¬ 
tration profiles taken at three different times for this diffusion situation are shown 
in Figure 5.9; these profiles may be compared and contrasted to those in Figure 5.5 
for the case wherein the surface concentration of diffusing species is held constant. 
In addition, Figure 5.10 compares (schematically) concentration profiles for prede¬ 
position and drive-in treatments. 

If we assume that the impurity atoms introduced during the predeposition treat¬ 
ment are confined to a very thin layer at the surface of the silicon (which, of course,

is only an approximation), then the solution to Fick’s second law (Equation 5.4b) 
takes the form 



(5.11) 


Here Q 0 represents the total amount of impurities in the solid that were introduced 
during the predeposition treatment (in number of impurity atoms per unit area); 
all other parameters in this equation have the same meanings as previously. Fur¬ 
thermore, it can be shown that 



(5.12) 


where C s is the surface concentration for the predeposition step (Figure 5.10), which 
was held constant, D p is the diffusion coefficient, and t p is the predeposition treat¬ 
ment time. 

Another important diffusion parameter is junction depth, x r It represents the 
depth (i.e., value of x) at which the diffusing impurity concentration is just equal to 
the background concentration of that impurity in the silicon ( C B ) (Figure 5.10). For 
drive-in diffusion Xj may be computed using the following expression: 



(5.13) 


Here D d and t d represent, respectively, the diffusion coefficient and time for the 
drive-in treatment. 

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 5.6 


Diffusion of Boron into Silicon 

Boron atoms are to be diffused into a silicon wafer using both predeposition 
and drive-in heat treatments; the background concentration of B in this silicon 
material is known to be 1 X 10 20 atoms/m 3 . The predeposition treatment is to 
be conducted at 900°C for 30 minutes; the surface concentration of B is to be 
maintained at a constant level of 3 X 10 26 atoms/m 3 . Drive-in diffusion will be 
carried out at 1100°C for a period of 2 h. For the diffusion coefficient of B in 
Si, values of Q^and D 0 are 3.87 eV/atom and 2.4 X ICE 3 m 2 /s, respectively. 

(a) Calculate the value of Q 0 . 

(b) Determine the value of Xj for the drive-in diffusion treatment. 

(c) Also for the drive-in treatment, compute the concentration of B atoms at 
a position 1 jxm below the surface of the silicon wafer. 

Solution 

(a) The value of Q 0 is calculated using Equation 5.12. However, before this 
is possible, it is first necessary to determine the value of D for the pre¬ 
deposition treatment [D p at T = T p = 900°C (1173 K)] using Equation 5.8. 
{Note: For the gas constant R in Equation 5.8, we use Boltzmann’s constant 
k, which has a value of 8.62 X 1CT 5 eV/atom-K). Thus

(b) Computation of the junction depth requires that we use Equation 5.13. 
However, before this is possible it is necessary to calculate D at the tem¬

IMPORTANCE 

Aluminum for Integrated Circuit Interconnects 

Oubsequent to the predeposition and drive-in 
Oheat treatments just described, another impor¬ 
tant step in the IC fabrication process is the 

deposition of very thin and narrow conducting 
circuit paths to facilitate the passage of current 
from one device to another; these paths are called 


































5.6 Diffusion in Semiconducting Materials * 141 


interconnects, and several are shown in Figure 5.11, 
a scanning electron micrograph of an IC chip. Of 
course the material to be used for interconnects 
must have a high electrical conductivity—a metal, 
because, of all materials, metals have the highest 
conductivities. Table 5.3 cites values for silver, 
copper, gold, and aluminum, the most conductive 
metals. On the basis of these conductivities, and 
discounting material cost, Ag is the metal of 
choice, followed by Cu, Au, and Al. 

Once these interconnects have been de¬ 
posited, it is still necessary to subject the IC chip 
to other heat treatments, which may run as high as 
500°C. If, during these treatments, there is signifi¬ 
cant diffusion of the interconnect metal into the 
silicon, the electrical functionality of the IC will be 
destroyed. Thus, because the extent of diffusion is 
dependent on the magnitude of the diffusion co¬ 
efficient, it is necessary to select an interconnect 
metal that has a small value of D in silicon. Fig¬ 
ure 5.12 plots the logarithm of D versus 1 IT for the 
diffusion, into silicon, of copper, gold, silver, and 
aluminum. Also, a dashed vertical line has been 
constructed at 500°C, from which values of D for 
the four metals are noted at this temperature. Here 
it may be seen that the diffusion coefficient for alu¬ 
minum in silicon (2.5 X 1CT 21 m 2 /s) is at least four 
orders of magnitude (i.e., a factor of 10 4 ) lower than 
the values for the other three metals.

Aluminum is indeed used for interconnects 
in some integrated circuits; even though its elec¬ 
trical conductivity is slightly lower than the val¬ 
ues for silver, copper, and gold, its extremely low 
diffusion coefficient makes it the material of 
choice for this application. An aluminum-copper- 
silicon alloy (94.5 wt% Al-4 wt% Cu-1.5 wt% Si) 
is sometimes also used for interconnects; it not 
only bonds easily to the surface of the chip, but 
is also more corrosion resistant than pure alu¬ 
minum. 

More recently, copper interconnects have also 
been used. However, it is first necessary to deposit 
a very thin layer of tantalum or tantalum nitride 
beneath the copper, which acts as a barrier to de¬ 
ter diffusion of Cu into the silicon.

5.7 OTHER DIFFUSION PATHS 

Atomic migration may also occur along dislocations, grain boundaries, and exter¬ 
nal surfaces. These are sometimes called “ short-circuit ” diffusion paths inasmuch as 
rates are much faster than for bulk diffusion. However, in most situations short-circuit 
contributions to the overall diffusion flux are insignificant because the cross- 
sectional areas of these paths are extremely small. 

SUMMARY 


Introduction 

• Solid-state diffusion is a means of mass transport within solid materials by step¬ 
wise atomic motion. 

• The term interdiffusion refers to the migration of impurity atoms; for host atoms, 
the term self-diffusion is used. 

Diffusion Mechanisms 

• Two mechanisms for diffusion are possible: vacancy and interstitial. 

Vacancy diffusion occurs via the exchange of an atom residing on a normal 
lattice site with an adjacent vacancy. 

For interstitial diffusion, an atom migrates from one interstitial position to 
an empty adjacent one. 

• For a given host metal, interstitial atomic species generally diffuse more rapidly. 

Steady-State Diffusion 

• Diffusion flux is defined in terms of mass of diffusing species, cross-sectional area, 
and time according to Equation 5.1a. 

• Concentration profile is represented as a plot of concentration versus distance 
into the solid material. 

• Concentration gradient is the slope of the concentration profile curve at some 
specific point. 

• The diffusion condition for which the flux is independent of time is known as 
steady state. 

• For steady-state diffusion, diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the 
concentration gradient according to Fick’s first law, Equation 5.3. 

• The driving force for steady-state diffusion is the concentration gradient ( dC/dx ). 

Nonsteady-State Diffusion 

• For nonsteady-state diffusion, there is a net accumulation or depletion of diffusing 
species and the flux is dependent on time. 

• The mathematics for nonsteady state in a single (x) direction (and when the 
diffusion coefficient is independent of concentration) are described by Fick’s 
second law, Equation 5.4b. 

• For a constant surface composition boundary condition, the solution to Fick’s 
second law (Equation 5.4b) is Equation 5.5, which involves the Gaussian error 
function (erf). 

Factors That Influence Diffusion 

• The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient is indicative of the rate of atomic mo¬ 
tion and depends on both host and diffusing species as well as on temperature. 

• The diffusion coefficient is a function of temperature according to Equation 5.8. 




Summary * 143 


Diffusion in Semiconducting Materials 

• The two heat treatments that are used to diffuse impurities into silicon during 
integrated circuit fabrication are predeposition and drive-in. 

During predeposition, impurity atoms are diffused into the silicon, often from 
a gas phase, the partial pressure of which is maintained constant. 

For the drive-in step, impurity atoms are transported deeper into the silicon 
so as to provide a more suitable concentration distribution without increas¬ 
ing the overall impurity content. 

• Integrated circuit interconnects are normally made of aluminum—instead of met¬ 
als such as copper, silver, and gold that have higher electrical conductivities—on 
the basis of diffusion considerations. During high-temperature heat treatments, 
interconnect metal atoms diffuse into the silicon; appreciable concentrations will 
compromise the chip’s functionality.

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

Diffusion in semiconducting materials was discussed in Section 5.6. For both pre¬ 
deposition and drive-in treatments, diffusion is nonsteady-state —solutions to 
Fick’s second law were provided for both. Nonsteady-state diffusion and these 
treatments are two of the processing components for silicon, as noted in the 
following diagram:

semiconductors (i.e., doping, Chapter 18), and, in addition, in the production of 
steel alloys (Chapter 10), an understanding of the temperature dependence of the 
diffusion coefficient (i.e., Equation 5.8) is essential. The following diagrams illus¬

5.6 The purification of hydrogen gas by diffusion 
through a palladium sheet was discussed in 
Section 5.3. Compute the number of kilo¬ 
grams of hydrogen that pass per hour through 
a 5-mm-thick sheet of palladium having an 
area of 0.20 m 2 at 500°C. Assume a diffusion 
coefficient of 1.0 X 10 -8 m 2 /s, that the con¬ 
centrations at the high- and low-pressure 
sides of the plate are 2.4 and 0.6 kg of 
hydrogen per cubic meter of palladium, and 
that steady-state conditions have been attained. 

5.7 A sheet of steel 1.5 mm thick has nitrogen 
atmospheres on both sides at 1200°C and is per¬ 
mitted to achieve a steady-state diffusion con¬ 
dition. The diffusion coefficient for nitrogen 
in steel at this temperature is 6 X 10 -11 m 2 /s, 
and the diffusion flux is found to be 1.2 X 
10 -7 kg/m 2 • s. Also, it is known that the con¬ 
centration of nitrogen in the steel at the high- 
pressure surface is 4 kg/m 3 . How far into the 
sheet from this high-pressure side will the 
concentration be 2.0 kg/m 3 ? Assume a linear 
concentration profile. 

5.8 A sheet of BCC iron 1 mm thick was exposed 
to a carburizing gas atmosphere on one side 


Furthermore, the values of D 0 and Q d for this 
diffusion system are 1.4 X 10 -7 m 2 /s and 
13,400 J/mol, respectively. Consider a thin 
iron membrane 1 mm thick that is at 250°C. 
Compute the diffusion flux through this mem¬ 
brane if the hydrogen pressure on one side of 
the membrane is 0.15 MPa (1.48 atm), and on 
the other side 7.5 MPa (74 atm).

5.11 Determine the carburizing time necessary to 
achieve a carbon concentration of 0.45 wt% at 
a position 2 mm into an iron-carbon alloy that 
initially contains 0.20 wt% C.The surface con¬ 
centration is to be maintained at 1.30 wt% C, 
and the treatment is to be conducted at 1000°C. 
Use the diffusion data for y-Fe in Table 5.2. 

5.12 An FCC iron-carbon alloy initially containing 
a tk 0.35 wt% C is exposed to an oxygen-rich and 

r ^ virtually carbon-free atmosphere at 1400 K 
M (1127°C). Under these circumstances the carbon 

diffuses from the alloy and reacts at the surface

with the oxygen in the atmosphere; that is, the 
carbon concentration at the surface position is 
maintained essentially at 0 wt% C. (This process 
of carbon depletion is termed decarburization.) 
At what position will the carbon concentration 
be 0.15 wt% after a 10-h treatment? The value 
of D at 1400 K is 6.9 X 10“ n m 2 /s. 

5.13 Nitrogen from a gaseous phase is to be dif¬ 
fused into pure iron at 700°C. If the surface 

ysJVvl concentration is maintained at 0.1 wt% N, 
|| what will be the concentration 1 mm from the 
surface after 10 h? The diffusion coefficient for 
nitrogen in iron at 700°C is 2.5 X 10 -11 m 2 /s. 

5.14 Consider a diffusion couple composed of two 
semi-infinite solids of the same metal, and 
that each side of the diffusion couple has a 
different concentration of the same elemen¬ 
tal impurity; furthermore, assume each impu¬ 
rity level is constant throughout its side of the 
diffusion couple. For this situation, the solu¬ 
tion to Fick’s second law (assuming that the 
diffusion coefficient for the impurity is inde¬ 
pendent of concentration) is as follows:

In this expression, when the x = 0 position is 
taken as the initial diffusion couple interface, 
then Cj is the impurity concentration for x < 0; 
likewise, C 2 is the impurity content for x > 0. 

A diffusion couple composed of two 
silver-gold alloys is formed; these alloys have 
compositions of 98 wt% Ag-2 wt% Au and 
95 wt% Ag-5 wt% Au. Determine the time 
this diffusion couple must be heated at 750°C 
(1023 K) in order for the composition to be 
2.5 wt% Au at the 50 jxm position into the 
2 wt% Au side of the diffusion couple. Pre¬ 
exponential and activation energy values for 
Au diffusion in Ag are 8.5 X 10 -5 m 2 /s and 
202,100 J/mol, respectively. 

5.15 For a steel alloy it has been determined that a 
carburizing heat treatment of 10-h duration will 
raise the carbon concentration to 0.45 wt% at 
a point 2.5 mm from the surface. Estimate the 
time necessary to achieve the same concentra¬ 
tion at a 5.0-mm position for an identical steel 
and at the same carburizing temperature.

700-h heat treatment at 1100°C (1373 K), the 
concentration of Cu is 2.5 wt% at the 3.0-mm 
position within the nickel. At what tempera¬ 
ture must the diffusion couple be heated to 
produce this same concentration (i.e., 2.5 wt% 
Cu) at a 2.0-mm position after 700 h? The pre¬

5.D1 It is desired to enrich the partial pressure of 
hydrogen in a hydrogen-nitrogen gas mixture 
for which the partial pressures of both gases 
are 0.1013 MPa (1 atm). It has been proposed 
to accomplish this by passing both gases 
through a thin sheet of some metal at an 
elevated temperature; inasmuch as hydrogen 
diffuses through the plate at a higher rate 
than does nitrogen, the partial pressure of 
hydrogen will be higher on the exit side of 
the sheet. The design calls for partial pressures 
of 0.0709 MPa (0.7 atm) and 0.02026 MPa (0.2 
atm), respectively, for hydrogen and nitro¬ 
gen. The concentrations of hydrogen and 
nitrogen (C H and C N , in mol/m 3 ) in this metal 
are functions of gas partial pressures (p H2 and 
Pn 2 , in MPa) and absolute temperature and 
are given by the following expressions:

5.D2 A gas mixture is found to contain two di¬ 
atomic A and B species for which the partial 
pressures of both are 0.05065 MPa (0.5 atm). 
This mixture is to be enriched in the partial 
pressure of the A species by passing both 
gases through a thin sheet of some metal at 
an elevated temperature. The resulting en¬ 
riched mixture is to have a partial pressure 
of 0.02026 MPa (0.2 atm) for gas A, and 
0.01013 MPa (0.1 atm) for gas B. The con¬

Nonsteady-State Diffusion 

(Factors That Influence Diffusion) 

5.D3 The wear resistance of a steel shaft is to be 
improved by hardening its surface. This is to 
be accomplished by increasing the nitrogen 
content within an outer surface layer as a 
result of nitrogen diffusion into the steel. The 
nitrogen is to be supplied from an external 
nitrogen-rich gas at an elevated and constant 
temperature. The initial nitrogen content of 
the steel is 0.002 wt%, whereas the surface 
concentration is to be maintained at 0.50 wt%. 
For this treatment to be effective, a nitrogen 
content of 0.10 wt% must be established at 
a position 0.40 mm below the surface. Spec¬ 
ify appropriate heat treatments in terms of 
temperature and time for temperatures be¬ 
tween 475°C and 625°C. The preexponential 
and activation energy for the diffusion of ni¬ 
trogen in iron are 3 X 10 -7 m 2 /s and 76,150 
J/mol, respectively, over this temperature 
range.

diffusion of arsenic into silicon wafers; the

treatment is to be conducted at 1000°C 
for 45 minutes, with a constant surface con¬ 
centration of 8 X 10 26 As atoms/m 3 . At a 
drive-in treatment temperature of 1100°C, 
determine the diffusion time required for a 
junction depth of 1.2 |xm. For this system, 
values of Q d and D 0 are 4.10 eV/atom and

the mechanical properties of metals 
using applied tensile forces (Sec¬

is a graph (plus inset) that was gen¬

versus strain (horizontal axis—related to the degree of specimen elongation). The 
manner in which the mechanical properties of modulus of elasticity (stiffness, E) as 
well as yield strength (cr y ), and tensile strength (TS) are determined as noted on 
these graphs. 

A suspension bridge is shown in Figure (c). 
The weight of the bridge deck and automo¬ 
biles imposes tensile forces on the vertical 
suspender cables. These forces are in turn 
transferred to the main suspension cable, 
which sags in a more-or-less parabolic shape. 
The metal alloy(s) from which these cables 
are constructed must meet certain stiffness 
and strength criteria. Stiffness and strength 
of the alloy(s) may be assessed from tests 
performed using a tensile-testing apparatus 
(and the resulting stress-strain plots) similar 
to those shown. [Figure (a): courtesy of

WHY STUDY The Mechanical Properties of Metals? 


It is incumbent on engineers to understand how the 
various mechanical properties are measured and what 
these properties represent; they may be called upon to 
design structures/components using predetermined 
materials such that unacceptable levels of deformation 
and/or failure will not occur. We demonstrate this 
procedure with respect to the design of a tensile-testing 
apparatus in Design Example 6.1. 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying mechanical properties of 
metals are as follows: 


Components made of steel alloys that are exposed 
to external stresses and forces must be processed so as 
to have appropriate levels of mechanical characteristics 
(i.e., stiffness, strength, ductility, and toughness). Thus, 
it is essential that the designer or engineer understand 
the significance of these properties, and, in addition, 
develop a sense of perspective as to acceptable 
magnitudes of property values.

the applied load, the instantaneous cross- 
sectional dimensions, and original and instanta¬ 
neous lengths, be able to compute true stress 
and true strain values.

different microindentation hardness testing 
techniques, and (b) cite situations for which 
these techniques are generally used.

6.1 INTRODUCTION 

Many materials, when in service, are subjected to forces or loads; examples include 
the aluminum alloy from which an airplane wing is constructed and the steel in an 
automobile axle. In such situations it is necessary to know the characteristics of the 
material and to design the member from which it is made such that any resulting 
deformation will not be excessive and fracture will not occur. The mechanical be¬ 
havior of a material reflects the relationship between its response or deformation 
to an applied load or force. Key mechanical design properties are stiffness, strength, 
hardness, ductility, and toughness. 

The mechanical properties of materials are ascertained by performing carefully 
designed laboratory experiments that replicate as nearly as possible the service 
conditions. Factors to be considered include the nature of the applied load and its du¬ 
ration, as well as the environmental conditions. It is possible for the load to be tensile, 
compressive, or shear, and its magnitude may be constant with time, or it may fluctu¬ 
ate continuously. Application time may be only a fraction of a second, or it may ex¬ 
tend over a period of many years. Service temperature may be an important factor.

152 * Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals 

Mechanical properties are of concern to a variety of parties (e.g., producers and 
consumers of materials, research organizations, government agencies) that have dif¬ 
fering interests. Consequently, it is imperative that there be some consistency in the 
manner in which tests are conducted and in the interpretation of their results. This 
consistency is accomplished by using standardized testing techniques. Establishment 
and publication of these standards are often coordinated by professional societies. 
In the United States the most active organization is the American Society for Testing 
and Materials (ASTM). Its Annual Book ofASTM Standards (http://www. astm.org) 
comprises numerous volumes, which are issued and updated yearly; a large number 
of these standards relate to mechanical testing techniques. Several of these are ref¬ 
erenced by footnote in this and subsequent chapters. 

The role of structural engineers is to determine stresses and stress distributions 
within members that are subjected to well-defined loads. This may be accomplished 
by experimental testing techniques and/or by theoretical and mathematical stress 
analyses. These topics are treated in traditional texts on stress analysis and strength 
of materials. 

Materials and metallurgical engineers, on the other hand, are concerned with pro¬ 
ducing and fabricating materials to meet service requirements as predicted by these 
stress analyses. This necessarily involves an understanding of the relationships between 
the microstructure (i.e., internal features) of materials and their mechanical properties. 

Materials are frequently chosen for structural applications because they have de¬ 
sirable combinations of mechanical characteristics. The present discussion is confined 
primarily to the mechanical behavior of metals; polymers and ceramics are treated 
separately because they are, to a large degree, mechanically different from metals. This 
chapter discusses the stress-strain behavior of metals and the related mechanical prop¬ 
erties, and also examines other important mechanical characteristics. Discussions of 
the microscopic aspects of deformation mechanisms and methods to strengthen and 
regulate the mechanical behavior of metals are deferred to later chapters. 

6.2 CONCEPTS OF STRESS AND STRAIN 

If a load is static or changes relatively slowly with time and is applied uniformly 
over a cross section or surface of a member, the mechanical behavior may be as¬ 
certained by a simple stress-strain test; these are most commonly conducted for 
metals at room temperature. There are three principal ways in which a load may 
be applied: namely, tension, compression, and shear (Figures 6.1a, b , c). In engi¬ 
neering practice many loads are torsional rather than pure shear; this type of load¬ 
ing is illustrated in Figure 6.1 d. 

Tension Tests 1 

One of the most common mechanical stress-strain tests is performed in tension. As 
will be seen, the tension test can be used to ascertain several mechanical properties 
of materials that are important in design. A specimen is deformed, usually to frac¬ 
ture, with a gradually increasing tensile load that is applied uniaxially along the long 
axis of a specimen. A standard tensile specimen is shown in Figure 6.2. Normally, the 
cross section is circular, but rectangular specimens are also used. This “dogbone” 
specimen configuration was chosen so that, during testing, deformation is confined 
to the narrow center region (which has a uniform cross section along its length), and 
also to reduce the likelihood of fracture at the ends of the specimen. The standard 
diameter is approximately 12.8 mm (0.5 in.), whereas the reduced section length

should be at least four times this diameter; 60 mm (2\ in.) is common. Gauge length 
is used in ductility computations, as discussed in Section 6.6; the standard value is 
50 mm (2.0 in.). The specimen is mounted by its ends into the holding grips of the 
testing apparatus (Figure 6.3). The tensile testing machine is designed to elongate 
the specimen at a constant rate and to continuously and simultaneously measure the 
instantaneous applied load (with a load cell) and the resulting elongations (using an 
extensometer). A stress-strain test typically takes several minutes to perform and is 
destructive; that is, the test specimen is permanently deformed and usually fractured. 
[The ( a ) chapter-opening photograph for this chapter is of a modern tensile-testing 
apparatus.] 

The output of such a tensile test is recorded (usually on a computer) as load 
or force versus elongation. These load-deformation characteristics are dependent 
on the specimen size. For example, it will require twice the load to produce the same 
elongation if the cross-sectional area of the specimen is doubled. To minimize these

sectional area before any load is applied (m 2 or in. 2 * ). The units of engineering stress 
(referred to subsequently as just stress ) are megapascals, MPa (SI) (where 1 MPa = 
10 6 N/m 2 ), and pounds force per square inch, psi (customary U.S.). 2

neous length. Sometimes the quantity l - l 0 is denoted as A/ and is the deformation 
elongation or change in length at some instant, as referenced to the original length. 
Engineering strain (subsequently called just strain ) is unitless, but meters per me¬ 
ter or inches per inch are often used; the value of strain is obviously independent 
of the unit system. Sometimes strain is also expressed as a percentage, in which the 
strain value is multiplied by 100. 

Compression Tests 3 

Compression stress-strain tests may be conducted if in-service forces are of this type. 
A compression test is conducted in a manner similar to the tensile test, except that the 
force is compressive and the specimen contracts along the direction of the stress. Equa¬ 
tions 6.1 and 6.2 are utilized to compute compressive stress and strain, respectively. By

convention, a compressive force is taken to be negative, which yields a negative stress. 
Furthermore, because / 0 is greater than l h compressive strains computed from Equation 
6.2 are necessarily also negative. Tensile tests are more common because they are eas¬ 
ier to perform; also, for most materials used in structural applications, very little addi¬ 
tional information is obtained from compressive tests. Compressive tests are used when 
a material’s behavior under large and permanent (i.e., plastic) strains is desired, as in 
manufacturing applications, or when the material is brittle in tension. 

Shear and Torsional Tests 4 

For tests performed using a pure shear force as shown in Figure 6.1c, the shear stress 
t is computed according to 


Definition of shear 
stress 

where F is the load or force imposed parallel to the upper and lower faces, each of 
which has an area of A 0 . The shear strain y is defined as the tangent of the strain 
angle 6 , as indicated in the figure. The units for shear stress and strain are the same 
as for their tensile counterparts. 

Torsion is a variation of pure shear, wherein a structural member is twisted in 
the manner of Figure 6.1 d\ torsional forces produce a rotational motion about the 
longitudinal axis of one end of the member relative to the other end. Examples of 
torsion are found for machine axles and drive shafts, and also for twist drills. Tor¬ 
sional tests are normally performed on cylindrical solid shafts or tubes. A shear 
stress t is a function of the applied torque T, whereas shear strain y is related to 
the angle of twist, <fi in Figure 6.1 d. 

Geometric Considerations of the Stress State 

Stresses that are computed from the tensile, compressive, shear, and torsional force 
states represented in Figure 6.1 act either parallel or perpendicular to planar faces of 
the bodies represented in these illustrations. Note that the stress state is a function of 
the orientations of the planes upon which the stresses are taken to act. For example, 
consider the cylindrical tensile specimen of Figure 6.4 that is subjected to a tensile 
stress a applied parallel to its axis. Furthermore, consider also the plane p-p’ that is 
oriented at some arbitrary angle 6 relative to the plane of the specimen end-face. Upon 
this plane p-p', the applied stress is no longer a pure tensile one. Rather, a more com¬ 
plex stress state is present that consists of a tensile (or normal) stress cr' that acts nor¬ 
mal to the p-p' plane and, in addition, a shear stress r' that acts parallel to this plane; 
both of these stresses are represented in the figure. Using mechanics of materials prin¬ 
ciples, 5 it is possible to develop equations for a' and r' in terms of a and 6 , as follows:

from one coordinate system to another coordinate system that has a different ori¬ 
entation. Such treatments are beyond the scope of the present discussion.

Metal Alloys 


The degree to which a structure deforms or strains depends on the magnitude of 
an imposed stress. For most metals that are stressed in tension and at relatively low 
levels, stress and strain are proportional to each other through the relationship 

a = Ee (6.5) 

This is known as Hooke’s law, and the constant of proportionality E (GPa or psi) 6 
is the modulus of elasticity, or Young’s modulus. For most typical metals the mag¬ 
nitude of this modulus ranges between 45 GPa (6.5 X 10 6 psi), for magnesium, and 
407 GPa (59 X 10 6 psi), for tungsten. Modulus of elasticity values for several metals 
at room temperature are presented in Table 6.1. 

Deformation in which stress and strain are proportional is called elastic 
deformation; a plot of stress (ordinate) versus strain (abscissa) results in a linear 
relationship, as shown in Figure 6.5. The slope of this linear segment corresponds 
to the modulus of elasticity E. This modulus may be thought of as stiffness, or a 
material’s resistance to elastic deformation. The greater the modulus, the stiffer 
the material, or the smaller the elastic strain that results from the application of 
a given stress. The modulus is an important design parameter used for computing 
elastic deflections. 

Elastic deformation is nonpermanent, which means that when the applied load 
is released, the piece returns to its original shape. As shown in the stress-strain plot 


6 The SI unit for the modulus of elasticity is gigapascal, GPa, where 1 GPa = 10 9 N/m 2 = 
10 3 MPa.

(Figure 6.5), application of the load corresponds to moving from the origin up and 
along the straight line. Upon release of the load, the line is traversed in the oppo¬ 
site direction, back to the origin. 

There are some materials (e.g., gray cast iron, concrete, and many polymers) 
for which this elastic portion of the stress-strain curve is not linear (Figure 6.6); 
hence, it is not possible to determine a modulus of elasticity as described previously. 
For this nonlinear behavior, either tangent or secant modulus is normally used. Tan¬ 
gent modulus is taken as the slope of the stress-strain curve at some specified level 
of stress, whereas secant modulus represents the slope of a secant drawn from the 
origin to some given point of the erne curve. The determination of these moduli is 
illustrated in Figure 6.6. 

On an atomic scale, macroscopic elastic strain is manifested as small changes 
in the interatomic spacing and the stretching of interatomic bonds. As a conse¬ 
quence, the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity is a measure of the resistance 
to separation of adjacent atoms, that is, the interatomic bonding forces. Further¬ 
more, this modulus is proportional to the slope of the interatomic force-separation 
curve (Figure 2.8a) at the equilibrium spacing:

Figure 6.7 shows the force-separation curves for materials having both strong and 
weak interatomic bonds; the slope at r 0 is indicated for each.

Relationship 
between shear stress 
and shear strain for 
elastic deformation 


Values of the modulus of elasticity for ceramic materials are about the same as 
for metals; for polymers they are lower (Figure 1.4). These differences are a direct 
consequence of the different types of atomic bonding in the three materials types. 
Furthermore, with increasing temperature, the modulus of elasticity diminishes, as 
is shown for several metals in Figure 6.8. 

As would be expected, the imposition of compressive, shear, or torsional stresses 
also evokes elastic behavior. The stress-strain characteristics at low stress levels are 
virtually the same for both tensile and compressive situations, to include the mag¬ 
nitude of the modulus of elasticity. Shear stress and strain are proportional to each 
other through the expression 


r = Gy (6.7) 

where G is the shear modulus, the slope of the linear elastic region of the shear 
stress-strain curve. Table 6.1 also gives the shear moduli for a number of the com¬ 
mon metals.

6.4 ANELASTICITY 

Up to this point, it has been assumed that elastic deformation is time independent— 
that is, that an applied stress produces an instantaneous elastic strain that remains con¬ 
stant over the period of time the stress is maintained. It has also been assumed that 
upon release of the load the strain is totally recovered—that is, that the strain imme¬ 
diately returns to zero. In most engineering materials, however, there will also exist a 
time-dependent elastic strain component. That is, elastic deformation will continue af¬ 
ter the stress application, and upon load release some finite time is required for com- 
anelasticity plete recovery. This time-dependent elastic behavior is known as anelasticity, and it is 

due to time-dependent microscopic and atomistic processes that are attendant to the 
deformation. For metals the anelastic component is normally small and is often neg¬ 
lected. However, for some polymeric materials its magnitude is significant; in this case 
it is termed viscoelastic behavior, which is the discussion topic of Section 15.4. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 6.1 


Elongation (Elastic) Computation 

A piece of copper originally 305 mm (12 in.) long is pulled in tension with a 
stress of 276 MPa (40,000 psi). If the deformation is entirely elastic, what will 
be the resultant elongation? 


Solution 


Because the deformation is elastic, strain is dependent on stress according to 
Equation 6.5. Furthermore, the elongation A/ is related to the original length / 0 
through Equation 6.2. Combining these two expressions and solving for A/ yields 


a = eE = 




E

The values of cr and / 0 are given as 276 MPa and 305 mm, respectively, and 
the magnitude of E for copper from Table 6.1 is 110 GPa (16 X 10 6 psi). Elon¬ 
gation is obtained by substitution into the preceding expression as

6.5 ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS 


Poisson’s ratio 


Definition of 
Poisson’s ratio in 
terms of lateral 
and axial strains 


When a tensile stress is imposed on a metal specimen, an elastic elongation and ac¬ 
companying strain e z result in the direction of the applied stress (arbitrarily taken 
to be the z direction), as indicated in Figure 6.9. As a result of this elongation, there 
will be constrictions in the lateral (x and y) directions perpendicular to the applied 
stress; from these contractions, the compressive strains e x and e y may be determined. 
If the applied stress is uniaxial (only in the z direction), and the material is isotropic, 
then e x = e y . A parameter termed Poisson’s ratio v is defined as the ratio of the 
lateral and axial strains, or 




( 6 . 8 ) 


For virtually all structural materials, e x and e z will be of opposite sign; therefore, the 
negative sign is included in the preceding expression to ensure that v is positive. 7 
Theoretically, Poisson’s ratio for isotropic materials should be \\ furthermore, the 
maximum value for v (or that value for which there is no net volume change) is 
0.50. For many metals and other alloys, values of Poisson’s ratio range between 0.25 
and 0.35. Table 6.1 shows v values for several common metallic materials.

2 Solid lines represent dimensions after 
stress application; dashed lines, before. 


7 Some materials (e.g., specially prepared polymer foams) when pulled in tension actually 
expand in the transverse direction. Thus, both e x and e z of Equation 6.8 are positive such 
that Poisson’s ratio is negative. Materials that exhibit this effect are termed auxetics. 

















6.5 Elastic Properties Of Materials * 161 


Relationship among 
elastic parameters— 
modulus of elasticity, 
shear modulus, and 
Poisson’s ratio 


For isotropic materials, shear and elastic moduli are related to each other and 
to Poisson’s ratio according to 


E = 2G(l + v) (6.9) 

In most metals G is about OAE ; thus, if the value of one modulus is known, the 
other may be approximated. 

Many materials are elastically anisotropic; that is, the elastic behavior (e.g., the 
magnitude of E) varies with crystallographic direction (see Table 3.3). For these 
materials the elastic properties are completely characterized only by the specifica¬ 
tion of several elastic constants, their number depending on characteristics of the 
crystal structure. Even for isotropic materials, for complete characterization of the 
elastic properties, at least two constants must be given. Because the grain orientation 
is random in most polycrystalline materials, these may be considered to be isotropic; 
inorganic ceramic glasses are also isotropic. The remaining discussion of mechani¬ 
cal behavior assumes isotropy and polycrystallinity because such is the character of 
most engineering materials. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 6.2 

Computation of Load to Produce 
Specified Diameter Change 

A tensile stress is to be applied along the long axis of a cylindrical brass rod 
that has a diameter of 10 mm (0.4 in.). Determine the magnitude of the load 
required to produce a 2.5 X 10 -3 mm (10 -4 in.) change in diameter if the 
deformation is entirely elastic. 

Solution 

This deformation situation is represented in the accompanying drawing. 





















162 * Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals 


When the force F is applied, the specimen will elongate in the z direction and 
at the same time experience a reduction in diameter, Ad, of 2.5 X 10 -3 mm in 
the x direction. For the strain in the x direction, 


Ad _ -2.5 X 10 3 mm 
* d 0 10 mm 


-2.5 X 10“ 4 


which is negative, because the diameter is reduced. 

It next becomes necessary to calculate the strain in the z direction using 
Equation 6.8. The value for Poisson’s ratio for brass is 0.34 (Table 6.1), and thus 


e 


z 



(-2.5 X 10“ 4 )

The applied stress may now be computed using Equation 6.5 and the modu¬ 
lus of elasticity, given in Table 6.1 as 97 GPa (14 X 10 6 psi), as 

a = e z E = (7.35 X 10~ 4 )(97 X 10 3 MPa) = 71.3 MPa 

Finally, from Equation 6.1, the applied force may be determined as

10 X 10“ 3 m v 


tt = 5600 N (1293 lb f ) 


Plastic Deformation 


For most metallic materials, elastic deformation persists only to strains of about 
0.005. As the material is deformed beyond this point, the stress is no longer pro¬ 
portional to strain (Hooke’s law, Equation 6.5, ceases to be valid), and permanent, 
plastic deformation nonrecoverable, or plastic deformation occurs. Figure 6.10a plots schematically the 
tensile stress-strain behavior into the plastic region for a typical metal. The transi¬ 
tion from elastic to plastic is a gradual one for most metals; some curvature results 
at the onset of plastic deformation, which increases more rapidly with rising stress. 

From an atomic perspective, plastic deformation corresponds to the breaking 
of bonds with original atom neighbors and then re-forming bonds with new neigh¬ 
bors as large numbers of atoms or molecules move relative to one another; upon 
removal of the stress they do not return to their original positions. The mechanism 
of this deformation is different for crystalline and amorphous materials. For crys¬ 
talline solids, deformation is accomplished by means of a process called slip, which 
involves the motion of dislocations as discussed in Section 7.2. Plastic deformation 
in noncrystalline solids (as well as liquids) occurs by a viscous flow mechanism, 
which is outlined in Section 12.10. 


6.6 TENSILE PROPERTIES 

Yielding and Yield Strength 

Most structures are designed to ensure that only elastic deformation will result when 
a stress is applied. A structure or component that has plastically deformed, or 
Metal Alloys experienced a permanent change in shape, may not be capable of functioning as

intended. It is therefore desirable to know the stress level at which plastic defor¬ 
mation begins, or where the phenomenon of yielding occurs. For metals that expe¬ 
rience this gradual elastic-plastic transition, the point of yielding may be determined 
as the initial departure from linearity of the stress-strain curve; this is sometimes 
called the proportional limit, as indicated by point P in Figure 6.10a, and represents 
the onset of plastic deformation on a microscopic level. The position of this point 
P is difficult to measure precisely. As a consequence, a convention has been estab¬ 
lished wherein a straight line is constructed parallel to the elastic portion of the 
stress-strain curve at some specified strain offset, usually 0.002. The stress 
corresponding to the intersection of this line and the stress-strain curve as it bends 
over in the plastic region is defined as the yield strength oy 8 This is demonstrated 
in Figure 6.10a. Of course, the units of yield strength are MPa or psi. 9 

For those materials having a nonlinear elastic region (Figure 6.6), use of the 
strain offset method is not possible, and the usual practice is to define the yield 
strength as the stress required to produce some amount of strain (e.g., e = 0.005). 

Some steels and other materials exhibit the tensile stress-strain behavior shown 
in Figure 6.105. The elastic-plastic transition is very well defined and occurs abruptly 
in what is termed a yield point phenomenon. At the upper yield point, plastic de¬ 
formation is initiated with an apparent decrease in engineering stress. Continued 
deformation fluctuates slightly about some constant stress value, termed the lower 
yield point; stress subsequently rises with increasing strain. For metals that display 
this effect, the yield strength is taken as the average stress that is associated with 
the lower yield point, because it is well defined and relatively insensitive to the 


8 Strength is used in lieu of stress because strength is a property of the metal, whereas 
stress is related to the magnitude of the applied load. 

9 For customary U.S. units, the unit of kilopounds per square inch (ksi) is sometimes used 
for the sake of convenience, where

testing procedure. 10 Thus, it is not necessary to employ the strain offset method for 
these materials. 

The magnitude of the yield strength for a metal is a measure of its resistance 
to plastic deformation. Yield strengths may range from 35 MPa (5000 psi) for a low- 
strength aluminum to over 1400 MPa (200,000 psi) for high-strength steels.

Tensile Strength 

After yielding, the stress necessary to continue plastic deformation in metals in¬ 
creases to a maximum, point M in Figure 6.11, and then decreases to the eventual 
tensile strength fracture, point F. The tensile strength TS (MPa or psi) is the stress at the maximum 

on the engineering stress-strain curve (Figure 6.11). This corresponds to the maxi¬ 
mum stress that can be sustained by a structure in tension; if this stress is applied 
and maintained, fracture will result. All deformation up to this point is uniform 
throughout the narrow region of the tensile specimen. However, at this maximum 
stress, a small constriction or neck begins to form at some point, and all subsequent 
deformation is confined at this neck, as indicated by the schematic specimen insets

during loading.

in Figure 6.11. This phenomenon is termed necking , and fracture ultimately occurs 
at the neck. 11 The fracture strength corresponds to the stress at fracture. 

Tensile strengths may vary anywhere from 50 MPa (7000 psi) for an aluminum to 
as high as 3000 MPa (450,000 psi) for the high-strength steels. Ordinarily, when the 
strength of a metal is cited for design purposes, the yield strength is used. This is be¬ 
cause by the time a stress corresponding to the tensile strength has been applied, often 
a structure has experienced so much plastic deformation that it is useless. Furthermore, 
fracture strengths are not normally specified for engineering design purposes.

Inasmuch as the line segment passes through the origin, it is convenient to 
take both cr 1 and e, as zero. If cr 2 is arbitrarily taken as 150 MPa, then e 2 will 
have a value of 0.0016. Therefore, 


(150 - 0) MPa 
0.0016 - 0 


= 93.8 GPa (13.6 X 10 6 psi) 


which is very close to the value of 97 GPa (14 X 10 6 psi) given for brass in 
Table 6.1. 

(b) The 0.002 strain offset line is constructed as shown in the inset; its inter¬ 
section with the stress-strain curve is at approximately 250 MPa (36,000 psi), 
which is the yield strength of the brass. 

(c) The maximum load that can be sustained by the specimen is calculated 
by using Equation 6.1, in which a is taken to be the tensile strength, from 
Figure 6.12, 450 MPa (65,000 psi). Solving for F , the maximum load, yields 



= (450 X 10 6 N/m 2 ) ^ 12 - 8 x ^ 10 n = 57900 N (i 3)0 00 lb f ) 


(d) To compute the change in length, A/, in Equation 6.2, it is first necessary 
to determine the strain that is produced by a stress of 345 MPa. This is 
accomplished by locating the stress point on the stress-strain curve, point A , 
and reading the corresponding strain from the strain axis, which is ap¬ 
proximately 0.06. Inasmuch as / 0 = 250 mm, we have 

A l = el 0 = (0.06)(250 mm) = 15 mm (0.6 in.) 


Ductility 

Ductility is another important mechanical property. It is a measure of the degree 
of plastic deformation that has been sustained at fracture. A metal that experiences 
very little or no plastic deformation upon fracture is termed brittle. The tensile 
stress-strain behaviors for both ductile and brittle metals are schematically illus¬ 
trated in Figure 6.13. 

Ductility may be expressed quantitatively as either percent elongation or per¬ 
cent reduction in area. The percent elongation %EL is the percentage of plastic 
strain at fracture, or 


%EL

where If is the fracture length 12 and / 0 is the original gauge length as given earlier. 
Inasmuch as a significant proportion of the plastic deformation at fracture is 
confined to the neck region, the magnitude of %EL will depend on specimen gauge 
length. The shorter / 0 , the greater the fraction of total elongation from the neck and, 
consequently, the higher the value of %EL. Therefore, / 0 should be specified when 
percent elongation values are cited; it is commonly 50 mm (2 in.). 

Percent reduction in area %RA is defined as 

Ductility, as percent 
reduction in area 

where A 0 is the original cross-sectional area and A f is the cross-sectional area at the 
point of fracture. 12 Percent reduction in area values are independent of both / 0 and 
A 0 . Furthermore, for a given material the magnitudes of %EL and %RA will, in 
general, be different. Most metals possess at least a moderate degree of ductility at 
room temperature; however, some become brittle as the temperature is lowered 
(Section 8.6). 

A knowledge of the ductility of materials is important for at least two reasons. 
First, it indicates to a designer the degree to which a structure will deform plasti¬ 
cally before fracture. Second, it specifies the degree of allowable deformation during 
fabrication operations. We sometimes refer to relatively ductile materials as being 
“forgiving,” in the sense that they may experience local deformation without frac¬ 
ture should there be an error in the magnitude of the design stress calculation. 

Brittle materials are approximately considered to be those having a fracture 
strain of less than about 5%. 

Thus, several important mechanical properties of metals may be determined 
from tensile stress-strain tests. Table 6.2 presents some typical room-temperature 
values of yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility for several common metals. 
These properties are sensitive to any prior deformation, the presence of impurities, 
and/or any heat treatment to which the metal has been subjected. The modulus of 
elasticity is one mechanical parameter that is insensitive to these treatments. As 
with modulus of elasticity, the magnitudes of both yield and tensile strengths decline

with increasing temperature; just the reverse holds for ductility—it usually increases 
with temperature. Figure 6.14 shows how the stress-strain behavior of iron varies with 
temperature. 

Resilience 

Resilience is the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elas¬ 
tically and then, upon unloading, to have this energy recovered. The associated prop¬ 
erty is the modulus of resilience, U n which is the strain energy per unit volume 
required to stress a material from an unloaded state up to the point of yielding. 

Computationally, the modulus of resilience for a specimen subjected to a uni¬ 
axial tension test is just the area under the engineering stress-strain curve taken to 
yielding (Figure 6.15), or

6.6 Tensile Properties * 169 



Figure 6.15 Schematic representation showing how modulus 
of resilience (corresponding to the shaded area) is determined 
from the tensile stress-strain behavior of a material. 


The units of resilience are the product of the units from each of the two axes 
of the stress-strain plot. For SI units, this is joules per cubic meter (J/m 3 , equiva¬ 
lent to Pa), whereas with customary U.S. units it is inch-pounds force per cubic inch 
(in.-lb f /in. 3 , equivalent to psi). Both joules and inch-pounds force are units of en¬ 
ergy, and thus this area under the stress-strain curve represents energy absorption 
per unit volume (in cubic meters or cubic inches) of material.

Hooke’s law 

Thus, resilient materials are those having high yield strengths and low moduli of 
elasticity; such alloys would be used in spring applications. 

Toughness 

toughness Toughness is a mechanical term that may be used in several contexts. For one, 

toughness (or more specifically, fracture toughness) is a property that is indicative 
of a material’s resistance to fracture when a crack (or other stress-concentrating 
defect) is present (as discussed in Section 8.5). Because it is nearly impossible (as 
well as costly) to manufacture materials with zero defects (or to prevent damage 
during service), fracture toughness is a major consideration for all structural 
materials. 

Another way of defining toughness is as the ability of a material to absorb en¬ 
ergy and plastically deform before fracturing. For dynamic (high strain rate) load¬ 
ing conditions and when a notch (or point of stress concentration) is present, notch 
toughness is assessed by using an impact test, as discussed in Section 8.6. 

For the static (low strain rate) situation, a measure of toughness in metals (de¬ 
rived from plastic deformation) may be ascertained from the results of a tensile 
stress-strain test. It is the area under the cr-e curve up to the point of fracture. The 
units are the same as for resilience (i.e., energy per unit volume of material). For a 
metal to be tough, it must display both strength and ductility. This is demonstrated 
in Figure 6.13, in which the stress-strain curves are plotted for both metal types. 
Hence, even though the brittle metal has higher yield and tensile strengths, it has a 
lower toughness than the ductile one, as can be seen by comparing the areas ABC 
and AB'C' in Figure 6.13.

6.7 TRUE STRESS AND STRAIN 

From Figure 6.11, the decline in the stress necessary to continue deformation past 
the maximum, point M, seems to indicate that the metal is becoming weaker. This 
is not at all the case; as a matter of fact, it is increasing in strength. However, the 
cross-sectional area is decreasing rapidly within the neck region, where deformation 
is occurring. This results in a reduction in the load-bearing capacity of the specimen. 
The stress, as computed from Equation 6.1, is on the basis of the original cross- 
sectional area before any deformation and does not take into account this reduction 
in area at the neck. 

true stress Sometimes it is more meaningful to use a true stress-true strain scheme. True 

stress <j t is defined as the load F divided by the instantaneous cross-sectional area 
A t over which deformation is occurring (i.e., the neck, past the tensile point), or

the complex stress state within the 
neck region. 


e) (6.18a) 

ln(l + e) (6.18b) 

Equations 6.18a and 6.18b are valid only to the onset of necking; beyond this point 
true stress and strain should be computed from actual load, cross-sectional area, 
and gauge length measurements. 

A schematic comparison of engineering and true stress-strain behaviors is made 
in Figure 6.16. It is worth noting that the true stress necessary to sustain increasing 
strain continues to rise past the tensile point M f . 

Coincident with the formation of a neck is the introduction of a complex stress 
state within the neck region (i.e., the existence of other stress components in addi¬ 
tion to the axial stress). As a consequence, the correct stress {axial) within the neck 
is slightly lower than the stress computed from the applied load and neck cross- 
sectional area. This leads to the “corrected” curve in Figure 6.16. 

For some metals and alloys the region of the true stress-strain curve from the 
onset of plastic deformation to the point at which necking begins may be approxi¬ 
mated by

In this expression, K and n are constants; these values will vary from ahoy to ahoy 
and will also depend on the condition of the material (i.e., whether it has been plas¬ 
tically deformed, heat-treated, etc.). The parameter n is often termed the strain¬ 
hardening exponent and has a value less than unity. Values of n and K for several 
alloys are contained in Table 6.4.

is 10.7 mm (0.422 in.), determine:

6.8 ELASTIC RECOVERY AFTER PLASTIC 
DEFORMATION 

Upon release of the load during the course of a stress-strain test, some fraction of 
the total deformation is recovered as elastic strain. This behavior is demonstrated 
in Figure 6.17, a schematic engineering stress-strain plot. During the unloading cycle, 
the curve traces a near straight-line path from the point of unloading (point D ), 
and its slope is virtually identical to the modulus of elasticity, or parallel to the ini¬ 
tial elastic portion of the curve. The magnitude of this elastic strain, which is re¬ 
gained during unloading, corresponds to the strain recovery, as shown in Figure 6.17. 
If the load is reapplied, the curve will traverse essentially the same linear portion 
in the direction opposite to unloading; yielding will again occur at the unloading 
stress level where the unloading began. There will also be an elastic strain recov¬ 
ery associated with fracture. 

6.9 COMPRESSIVE, SHEAR, AND TORSIONAL 
DEFORMATIONS 

Of course, metals may experience plastic deformation under the influence of ap¬ 
plied compressive, shear, and torsional loads. The resulting stress-strain behavior 
into the plastic region will be similar to the tensile counterpart (Figure 6.10a: yield¬ 
ing and the associated curvature). However, for compression, there will be no max¬ 
imum, because necking does not occur; furthermore, the mode of fracture will be 
different from that for tension.

hardness 


HARDNESS 

Another mechanical property that may be important to consider is hardness, which 
is a measure of a material’s resistance to localized plastic deformation (e.g., a small 
dent or a scratch). Early hardness tests were based on natural minerals with a scale 
constructed solely on the ability of one material to scratch another that was softer. 
A qualitative and somewhat arbitrary hardness indexing scheme was devised, termed 
the Mohs scale, which ranged from 1 on the soft end for talc to 10 for diamond. 
Quantitative hardness techniques have been developed over the years in which a 
small indenter is forced into the surface of a material to be tested, under controlled 
conditions of load and rate of application. The depth or size of the resulting indenta¬ 
tion is measured, which in turn is related to a hardness number; the softer the mate¬ 
rial, the larger and deeper the indentation, and the lower the hardness index number. 
Measured hardnesses are only relative (rather than absolute), and care should be 
exercised when comparing values determined by different techniques. 

Hardness tests are performed more frequently than any other mechanical test 
for several reasons: 

1. They are simple and inexpensive—ordinarily no special specimen need be 
prepared, and the testing apparatus is relatively inexpensive. 

2. The test is nondestructive—the specimen is neither fractured nor excessively 
deformed; a small indentation is the only deformation. 

3. Other mechanical properties often may be estimated from hardness data, 
such as tensile strength (see Figure 6.19). 

Rockwell Hardness Tests 13 

The Rockwell tests constitute the most common method used to measure hardness 
because they are so simple to perform and require no special skills. Several differ¬ 
ent scales may be utilized from possible combinations of various indenters and dif¬ 
ferent loads, which permit the testing of virtually all metal alloys (as well as some 
polymers). Indenters include spherical and hardened steel balls having diameters 
of Y 6 ,1, 5 , and | in. (1.588,3.175,6.350, and 12.70 mm), and a conical diamond (Brale) 
indenter, which is used for the hardest materials. 

With this system, a hardness number is determined by the difference in depth 
of penetration resulting from the application of an initial minor load followed 
by a larger major load; utilization of a minor load enhances test accuracy. On the 
basis of the magnitude of both major and minor loads, there are two types of 
tests: Rockwell and superficial Rockwell. For Rockwell, the minor load is 10 kg, 
whereas major loads are 60,100, and 150 kg. Each scale is represented by a let¬ 
ter of the alphabet; several are listed with the corresponding indenter and load 
in Tables 6.5 and 6 . 6 a. For superficial tests, 3 kg is the minor load; 15, 30, and 45 
kg are the possible major load values. These scales are identified by a 15, 30, or 
45 (according to load), followed by N, T, W, X, or Y, depending on indenter. 
Superficial tests are frequently performed on thin specimens. Table 6 . 6 b presents 
several superficial scales. 

When specifying Rockwell and superficial hardnesses, both hardness number 
and scale symbol must be indicated. The scale is designated by the symbol HR 


13 ASTM Standard E 18, “Standard Test Methods for Rockwell Hardness of Metallic 
Materials.”

followed by the appropriate scale identification. 14 For example, 80 HRB represents 
a Rockwell hardness of 80 on the B scale, and 60 HR30W indicates a superficial 
hardness of 60 on the 30W scale. 

For each scale, hardnesses may range up to 130; however, as hardness values 
rise above 100 or drop below 20 on any scale, they become inaccurate; and because 
the scales have some overlap, in such a situation it is best to utilize the next harder 
or softer scale. 

Inaccuracies also result if the test specimen is too thin, if an indentation is made 
too near a specimen edge, or if two indentations are made too close to one another. 
Specimen thickness should be at least ten times the indentation depth, whereas 
allowance should be made for at least three indentation diameters between the center 
of one indentation and the specimen edge, or to the center of a second indentation. 
Furthermore, testing of specimens stacked one on top of another is not recom¬ 
mended. Also, accuracy is dependent on the indentation being made into a smooth 
flat surface. 

The modern apparatus for making Rockwell hardness measurements is auto¬ 
mated and very simple to use; hardness is read directly, and each measurement 
requires only a few seconds. This apparatus also permits a variation in the time of 
load application. This variable must also be considered in interpreting hardness data. 


14 Rockwell scales are also frequently designated by an R with the appropriate scale letter 
as a subscript, for example, R c denotes the Rockwell C scale. 









6.10 Hardness • 177 


Brinell Hardness Tests 15 

In Brinell tests, as in Rockwell measurements, a hard, spherical indenter is forced 
into the surface of the metal to be tested. The diameter of the hardened steel (or 
tungsten carbide) indenter is 10.00 mm (0.394 in.). Standard loads range between 
500 and 3000 kg in 500-kg increments; during a test, the load is maintained constant 
for a specified time (between 10 and 30 s). Harder materials require greater applied 
loads. The Brinell hardness number, HB, is a function of both the magnitude of the 
load and the diameter of the resulting indentation (see Table 6.5). 16 This diameter 
is measured with a special low-power microscope, utilizing a scale that is etched on 
the eyepiece. The measured diameter is then converted to the appropriate HB num¬ 
ber using a chart; only one scale is employed with this technique. 

Semiautomatic techniques for measuring Brinell hardness are available. These 
employ optical scanning systems consisting of a digital camera mounted on a flex¬ 
ible probe, which allows positioning of the camera over the indentation. Data from 
the camera are transferred to a computer that analyzes the indentation, determines 
its size, and then calculates the Brinell hardness number. For this technique, surface 
finish requirements are normally more stringent than for manual measurements. 

Maximum specimen thickness as well as indentation position (relative to spec¬ 
imen edges) and minimum indentation spacing requirements are the same as for 
Rockwell tests. In addition, a well-defined indentation is required; this necessitates 
a smooth flat surface in which the indentation is made.

Two other hardness-testing techniques are Knoop (pronounced riup ) and Vickers 
(sometimes also called diamond pyramid). For each test a very small diamond 
indenter having pyramidal geometry is forced into the surface of the specimen. Ap¬ 
plied loads are much smaller than for Rockwell and Brinell, ranging between 1 and 
1000 g.The resulting impression is observed under a microscope and measured; this 
measurement is then converted into a hardness number (Table 6.5). Careful 
specimen surface preparation (grinding and polishing) may be necessary to ensure 
a well-defined indentation that may be accurately measured. The Knoop and Vickers 
hardness numbers are designated by HK and HV, respectively, 18 and hardness scales 
for both techniques are approximately equivalent. Knoop and Vickers are referred to 
as microindentation-testing methods on the basis of indenter size. Both are well suited 
for measuring the hardness of small, selected specimen regions; furthermore, Knoop 
is used for testing brittle materials such as ceramics. (Section 12.11). 

The modern microindentation hardness-testing equipment has been automated 
by coupling the indenter apparatus to an image analyzer that incorporates a computer 
and software package. The software controls important system functions to include 
indent location, indent spacing, computation of hardness values, and plotting of data.

respectively.

Mechanical Properties of Metals 

Other hardness-testing techniques are frequently employed but will not be dis¬ 
cussed here; these include ultrasonic microhardness, and dynamic (Scleroscope), 
durometer (for plastic and elastomeric materials), and scratch hardness tests. These 
are described in references provided at the end of the chapter. 

Hardness Conversion 

The facility to convert the hardness measured on one scale to that of another is 
most desirable. However, because hardness is not a well-defined material property, 
and because of the experimental dissimilarities among the various techniques, a 
comprehensive conversion scheme has not been devised. Hardness conversion data 
have been determined experimentally and found to be dependent on material type 
and characteristics. The most reliable conversion data exist for steels, some of which 
are presented in Figure 6.18 for Knoop, Brinell, and two Rockwell scales; the Mohs 
scale is also included. Detailed conversion tables for various other metals and alloys

lation of conversion data from one alloy system to another. 

Correlation between Hardness and Tensile Strength 

Both tensile strength and hardness are indicators of a metal’s resistance to plastic 
deformation. Consequently, they are roughly proportional, as shown in Figure 6.19, 
for tensile strength as a function of the HB for cast iron, steel, and brass. The same 
proportionality relationship does not hold for ah metals, as Figure 6.19 indicates. 
As a rule of thumb for most steels, the HB and the tensile strength are related 
according to

Property Variability and 

Design/Safety Factors_ 

6.11 VARIABILITY OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES 

At this point it is worthwhile to discuss an issue that sometimes proves troublesome 
to many engineering students—namely, that measured material properties are not 
exact quantities. That is, even if we have a most precise measuring apparatus and a 
highly controlled test procedure, there will always be some scatter or variability in the 
data that are collected from specimens of the same material. For example, consider a 
number of identical tensile samples that are prepared from a single bar of some metal 
alloy, which samples are subsequently stress-strain tested in the same apparatus. We 
would most likely observe that each resulting stress-strain plot is slightly different from 
the others. This would lead to a variety of modulus of elasticity, yield strength, and ten¬ 
sile strength values. A number of factors lead to uncertainties in measured data. These 
include the test method, variations in specimen fabrication procedures, operator bias, 
and apparatus calibration. Furthermore, inhomogeneities may exist within the same 
lot of material, and/or slight compositional and other differences from lot to lot. Of 
course, appropriate measures should be taken to minimize the possibility of measure¬ 
ment error, and also to mitigate those factors that lead to data variability. 

It should also be mentioned that scatter exists for other measured material prop¬ 
erties such as density, electrical conductivity, and coefficient of thermal expansion. 

It is important for the design engineer to realize that scatter and variability of 
materials properties are inevitable and must be dealt with appropriately. On occa¬ 
sion, data must be subjected to statistical treatments and probabilities determined. 
For example, instead of asking the question, “What is the fracture strength of this 
alloy?” the engineer should become accustomed to asking the question, “What is 
the probability of failure of this alloy under these given circumstances?” 

It is often desirable to specify a typical value and degree of dispersion (or scat¬ 
ter) for some measured property; such is commonly accomplished by taking the av¬ 
erage and the standard deviation, respectively. 

Computation of Average and Standard Deviation Values 

An average value is obtained by dividing the sum of all measured values by the 
number of measurements taken. In mathematical terms, the average x of some 
parameter x is

where n is the number of observations or measurements and x t is the value of a dis¬ 
crete measurement. 

Furthermore, the standard deviation s is determined using the following 
expression:

where x h x, and n are defined earlier. A large value of the standard deviation cor¬ 
responds to a high degree of scatter.

plus the standard deviation (TS + s), whereas the lower error bar corresponds 
to the average minus the standard deviation (TS - s).

6.12 DESIGN/SAFETY FACTORS 

There will always be uncertainties in characterizing the magnitude of applied loads 
and their associated stress levels for in-service applications; ordinarily load calcu¬ 
lations are only approximate. Furthermore, as noted in the previous section, virtu¬ 
ally all engineering materials exhibit a variability in their measured mechanical 
properties, have imperfections that were introduced during manufacture, and, in 
some instances, will have sustained damage during service. Consequently, design ap¬ 
proaches must be employed to protect against unanticipated failure. During the 20th 
century, the protocol was to reduce the applied stress by a design safety factor. 
Although this is still an acceptable procedure for some structural applications, it does 
not provide adequate safety for critical applications such as those found in aircraft 
and bridge structural components. The current approach for these critical structural 
applications is to utilize materials that have adequate toughnesses and also offer 
redundancy in the structural design (i.e., excess or duplicate structures), provided 
there are regular inspections to detect the presence of flaws and, when necessary, 
safely remove or repair components. (These topics are discussed in Chapter 8, 
Failure —specifically Section 8.5.) 

design stress For less critical static situations and when tough materials are used, a design 

stress, a d , is taken as the calculated stress level a c (on the basis of the estimated 
maximum load) multiplied by a design factor ; N'; that is, 

^ = N’* c (6.23) 

where N' is greater than unity. Thus, the material to be used for the particular 
application is chosen so as to have a yield strength at least as high as this value 
of o> 













6.12 Design/Safety Factors * 183 


safe stress Alternatively, a safe stress or working stress , cr w , is used instead of design stress. 

This safe stress is based on the yield strength of the material and is defined as the 
yield strength divided by a factor of safety, N , or 

Computation of safe 
(or working) stress 

Utilization of design stress (Equation 6.23) is usually preferred because it is 
based on the anticipated maximum applied stress instead of the yield strength of 
the material; normally there is a greater uncertainty in estimating this stress level 
than in the specification of the yield strength. However, in the discussion of this 
text, we are concerned with factors that influence the yield strengths of metal al¬ 
loys and not in the determination of applied stresses; therefore, the succeeding dis¬ 
cussion will deal with working stresses and factors of safety. 

The choice of an appropriate value of N is necessary. If N is too large, then com¬ 
ponent overdesign will result; that is, either too much material or an alloy having a 
higher-than-necessary strength will be used. Values normally range between 1.2 and 
4.0. Selection of N will depend on a number of factors, including economics, previ¬ 
ous experience, the accuracy with which mechanical forces and material properties 
may be determined, and, most important, the consequences of failure in terms of 
loss of life and/or property damage. Because large N values lead to increased mate¬ 
rial cost and weight, structural designers are moving toward using tougher materi¬ 
als with redundant (and inspectable) designs, where economically feasible.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 6.1 


Specification of Support Post Diameter 


A tensile-testing apparatus is to be constructed that must withstand a maximum 
load of 220,000 N (50,000 lb f ). The design calls for two cylindrical support posts, 
each of which is to support half of the maximum load. Furthermore, plain-carbon 
(1045) steel ground and polished shafting rounds are to be used; the minimum 
yield and tensile strengths of this alloy are 310 MPa (45,000 psi) and 565 MPa 
(82,000 psi), respectively. Specify a suitable diameter for these support posts. 


Solution 

The first step in this design process is to decide on a factor of safety, N , which then 
allows determination of a working stress according to Equation 6.24. In addition, 
to ensure that the apparatus will be safe to operate, we also want to minimize any 
elastic deflection of the rods during testing; therefore, a relatively conservative fac¬ 
tor of safety is to be used, say N = 5. Thus, the working stress a w is just

where d is the rod diameter and F is the applied force; furthermore, each of the 
two rods must support half of the total force or 110,000 N (25,000 psi). Solving 
for d leads to 




110,000 N 


V tt(62 X 10 6 N/m 2 )

Therefore, the diameter of each of the two rods should be 47.5 mm or 1.87 in. 



SUMMARY 


Introduction 

• Three factors that should be considered in designing laboratory tests to assess 
the mechanical characteristics of materials for service use are the nature of the 
applied load (e.g., tension, compression, shear), load duration, and environmen¬ 
tal conditions. 

Concepts of Stress and Strain 

• For loading in tension and compression; 

Engineering stress a is defined as the instantaneous load divided by the orig¬ 
inal specimen cross-sectional area (Equation 6.1). 

Engineering strain e is expressed as the change in length (in the direction of 
load application) divided by the original length (Equation 6.2). 

Stress-Strain Behavior 

• A material that is stressed first undergoes elastic, or nonpermanent, deformation. 

• When most materials are deformed elastically, stress and strain are proportional — 
that is, a plot of stress versus strain is linear. 

• For tensile and compressive loading, the slope of the linear elastic region of the 
stress-strain curve is the modulus of elasticity (£), per Hooke’s law (Equation 6.5). 

• For a material that exhibits nonlinear elastic behavior, tangent and secant mod¬ 
uli are used. 

• On an atomic level, elastic deformation of a material corresponds to the stretch¬ 
ing of interatomic bonds and corresponding slight atomic displacements. 

• For shear elastic deformations, shear stress (r) and shear strain (y) are propor¬ 
tional to one another (Equation 6.7). The constant of proportionality is the shear 
modulus (G). 

• Elastic deformation that is dependent on time is termed anelastic. 

Elastic Properties of Materials 

• Another elastic parameter, Poisson’s ratio (v), represents the negative ratio of 
transverse and longitudinal strains (e x and e z , respectively)—Equation 6 . 8 . Typi¬ 
cal values of v for metals lie within the range of about 0.25 and 0.35. 








Summary * 185 


• For an isotropic material, shear and elastic moduli and Poisson’s ratio are related 
according to Equation 6.9. 

Tensile Properties 

• The phenomenon of yielding occurs at the onset of plastic or permanent defor¬ 
mation. 

• Yield strength is indicative of the stress at which plastic deformation begins. For 
most materials yield strength is determined from a stress-strain plot using the 
0.002 strain offset technique. 

• Tensile strength is taken as the stress level at the maximum point on the engi¬ 
neering stress-strain curve; it represents the maximum tensile stress that may be 
sustained by a specimen. 

• For most metallic materials, at the maxima on their stress-strain curves, a small 
constriction or neck begins to form at some point on the deforming specimen. 
All subsequent deformation ensues by the narrowing of this neck region, at which 
point fracture ultimately occurs. 

• Ductility is a measure of the degree to which a material will plastically deform 
by the time fracture occurs. 

• Quantitatively, ductility is measured in terms of percents elongation and reduc¬ 
tion in area. 

Percent elongation (%EL) is a measure of the plastic strain at fracture (Equa¬ 
tion 6.11). 

Percent reduction in area (%RA) may be calculated according to Equa¬ 
tion 6.12. 

• Yield and tensile strengths and ductility are sensitive to any prior deformation, 
the presence of impurities, and/or any heat treatment. Modulus of elasticity is rel¬ 
atively insensitive to these conditions. 

• With increasing temperature, values of elastic modulus as well as tensile and yield 
strengths decrease, whereas the ductility increases. 

• Modulus of resilience is the strain energy per unit volume of material required 
to stress a material to the point of yielding—or the area under the elastic portion 
of the engineering stress-strain curve. For a metal that displays linear-elastic 
behavior, its value may be determined using Equation 6.14. 

• A measure of toughness is the energy absorbed during the fracture of a mate¬ 
rial, as measured by the area under the entire engineering stress-strain curve. 
Ductile metals are normally tougher than brittle ones. 

True Stress and Strain 

• True stress (a T ) is defined as the instantaneous applied load divided by the in¬ 
stantaneous cross-sectional area (Equation 6.15). 

• True strain (e r ) is equal to the natural logarithm of the ratio of instantaneous and 
original specimen lengths per Equation 6.16. 

• For some metals from the onset of plastic deformation to the onset of necking, 
true stress and true strain are related by Equation 6.19. 

Elastic Recovery after Plastic Deformation 

• For a specimen that has been plastically deformed, elastic strain recovery will oc¬ 
cur if the load is released. This phenomenon is illustrated by the stress-strain plot 
of Figure 6.17. 


186 * Chapter 6 / Mechanical Properties of Metals 

Hardness 

• Hardness is a measure of a material’s resistance to localized plastic deformation. 

• The two most common hardness testing techniques are Rockwell and Brinell. 

Several scales are available for Rockwell; for Brinell there is a single scale. 

Brinell hardness is determined from indentation size; Rockwell is based on 
the difference in indentation depth from the imposition of minor and major 
loads. 

• Names of the two microindentation hardness testing techniques are Knoop and 
Vickers. Small indenters and relatively light loads are employed for these two 
techniques. They are used to measure hardnesses of brittle materials (such as ce¬ 
ramics), and also of very small specimen regions. 

• For some metals, a plot of hardness versus tensile strength is linear—that is, these 
two parameters are proportional to one another. 

Variability of Material Properties 

• Five factors that can lead to scatter in measured material properties are the fol¬ 
lowing: test method, variations in specimen fabrication procedure, operator bias, 
apparatus calibration, and inhomogeneities and/or compositional variations from 
sample to sample. 

• A typical material property is often specified in terms of an average value (x), 
while magnitude of scatter may be expressed as a standard deviation (s). Equa¬ 
tions 6.21 and 6.22, respectively, are used to calculate values for these parameters. 

Design/Safety Factors 

• As a result of uncertainties in both measured mechanical properties and in-serv¬ 
ice applied stresses, design or safe stresses are normally utilized for design pur¬ 
poses. For ductile materials, safe (or working) stress a w is dependent on yield 
strength and factor of safety as described in Equation 6.24.

of elasticity, yield strength, hardness, etc.). In order to improve the mechanical char¬ 
acteristics of metal alloys [e.g., steel (Chapter 10)], it is first necessary to understand 
what these properties represent. The following diagram illustrates this relationship

Concepts of Stress and Strain 

6.1 Using mechanics of materials principles (i.e., 
equations of mechanical equilibrium applied 
to a free-body diagram), derive Equations 
6.4a and 6.4b. 

6.2 (a) Equations 6.4a and 6.4b are expressions 
for normal (cr') and shear (t') stresses, re¬ 
spectively, as a function of the applied tensile 
stress (cr) and the inclination angle of the 
plane on which these stresses are taken (6 of 
Figure 6.4). Make a plot on which is presented 
the orientation parameters of these expres¬ 
sions (i.e., cos 2 6 and sin 6 cos 6) versus 6. 

(b) From this plot, at what angle of inclina¬ 
tion is the normal stress a maximum? 

(c) Also, at what inclination angle is the shear 
stress a maximum? 

Stress-Strain Behavior 

6.3 A specimen of aluminum having a rectangu¬ 
lar cross section 10 mm X 12.7 mm (0.4 in. X 


0.5 in.) is pulled in tension with 35,500 N 
(8000 lb f ) force, producing only elastic defor¬ 
mation. Calculate the resulting strain. 

6.4 A cylindrical specimen of a titanium alloy 
having an elastic modulus of 107 GPa (15.5 X 
10 6 psi) and an original diameter of 3.8 mm 
(0.15 in.) will experience only elastic de¬ 
formation when a tensile load of 2000 N 
(450 lb f ) is applied. Compute the maximum 
length of the specimen before deformation if 
the maximum allowable elongation is 0.42 
mm (0.0165 in.). 

6.5 A steel bar 100 mm (4.0 in.) long and having 
a square cross section 20 mm (0.8 in.) on an 
edge is pulled in tension with a load of 89,000 
N (20,000 lb f ) and experiences an elongation 
of 0.10 mm (4.0 X 10 -3 in.). Assuming that the

a load of 500 N (112 lb f ) is applied. Assume 
that the deformation is totally elastic. 

6.7 For a bronze alloy, the stress at which plastic 
deformation begins is 275 MPa (40,000 psi), 
and the modulus of elasticity is 115 GPa 
(16.7 X 10 6 psi). 

(a) What is the maximum load that may be 
applied to a specimen with a cross-sectional 
area of 325 mm 2 (0.5 in. 2 ) without plastic de¬ 
formation? 

(b) If the original specimen length is 115 mm 
(4.5 in.), what is the maximum length to which 
it may be stretched without causing plastic 
deformation? 

6.8 A cylindrical rod of copper (E = 110 GPa, 
16 X 10 6 psi) having a yield strength of 240 
MPa (35,000 psi) is to be subjected to a load 
of 6660 N (1500 lb f ). If the length of the rod 
is 380 mm (15.0 in.), what must be the di¬ 
ameter to allow an elongation of 0.50 mm 
( 0.020 in.)? 

6.9 Compute the elastic moduli for the follow¬

Metal Alloys Steering (VMSE): (a) titanium, (b) tem- 
pered steel, (c) aluminum, and (d) carbon 
steel. How do these values compare with 
those presented in Table 6.1 for the same 
metals? 


6.10 Consider a cylindrical specimen of a steel 
alloy (Figure 6.21) 10.0 mm (0.39 in.) in di¬ 
ameter and 75 mm (3.0 in.) long that is pulled 
in tension. Determine its elongation when a 
load of 20,000 N (4,500 lb f ) is applied. 

6.11 Figure 6.22 shows, for a gray cast iron, the ten¬

at 10.3 MPa (1500 psi) and (b) the secant 
modulus taken to 6.9 MPa (1000 psi). 

6.12 As noted in Section 3.15, for single crystals of 
some substances, the physical properties are 
anisotropic; that is, they are dependent on 
crystallographic direction. One such property 
is the modulus of elasticity. For cubic single 
crystals, the modulus of elasticity in a general 
[uvw] direction, E uvw , is described by the re¬ 
lationship 



(a 2 13 2 + (3 2 y 2 + y 2 a 2 ) 


where J E (100) and E {111) are the moduli of elas¬ 
ticity in [ 100 ] and [ 111 ] directions, respec¬ 
tively; a, and y are the cosines of the angles 
between [uvw] and the respective [ 100 ], [ 010 ], 
and [001] directions. Verify that the F( 110 ) val¬ 
ues for aluminum, copper, and iron in Table 
3.3 are correct.

distance r as follows: 



where A, B , and n are constants for the par¬ 
ticular ion pair. Equation 6.25 is also valid for 
the bonding energy between adjacent ions in 
solid materials. The modulus of elasticity E is 
proportional to the slope of the interionic 
force-separation curve at the equilibrium in¬ 
terionic separation; that is, 



Derive an expression for the dependence of 
the modulus of elasticity on these A , B , and n

following procedure: 

1. Establish a relationship for the force F as 
a function of r, realizing that

3. Develop an expression for r 0 , the equilib¬ 
rium separation. Because r 0 corresponds to the 
value of r at the minimum of the E n -versus-r 
curve (Figure 2.86), take the derivative 
dE N /dr , set it equal to zero, and solve for r, 
which corresponds to r 0 . 

4. Finally, substitute this expression for r 0 into 

the relationship obtained by taking dFIdr.

duces a reduction in specimen diameter of 
5 X 10 -3 mm (2 X 10 -4 in.). Compute Poisson’s 
ratio for this material if its modulus of elas¬

shear moduli for this alloy are 105 GPa and 
39.7 GPa, respectively. 

6.19 Consider a cylindrical specimen of some hy¬ 
pothetical metal alloy that has a diameter of 
8.0 mm (0.31 in.). A tensile force of 1000 N

imen of this alloy 12.7 mm (0.50 in.) in diame¬ 
ter and 250 mm (10.0 in.) long is stressed in 
tension and found to elongate 7.6 mm (0.30 in.). 
On the basis of the information given, is it pos¬ 
sible to compute the magnitude of the load that

mation will be totally elastic.

mm (3.2 X 10 -3 in.), which of the metals in 
Table 6.1 are suitable candidates? Why? 

(b) If, in addition, the maximum permissible di¬ 
ameter decrease is 1.2 X 10 -3 mm (4.7 X 10 -5 in.)

which of the metals that satisfy the criterion in 
part (a) are suitable candidates? Why?

6.42 A tensile test is performed on a metal speci¬ 
men, and it is found that a true plastic strain 
of 0.20 is produced when a true stress of 575 
MPa (83,500 psi) is applied; for the same 
metal, the value of K in Equation 6.19 is 860 
MPa (125,000 psi). Calculate the true strain 
that results from the application of a true 
stress of 600 MPa (87,000 psi). 

6.43 For some metal alloy, a true stress of 415 MPa 
(60,175 psi) produces a plastic true strain of 
0.475. How much will a specimen of this ma¬ 
terial elongate when a true stress of 325 MPa 
(46,125 psi) is applied if the original length is 
300 mm (11.8 in.)? Assume a value of 0.25 for 
the strain-hardening exponent n.

What true stress is necessary to produce a true

On the basis of this information, compute the

6.46 Find the toughness (or energy to cause frac¬ 
ture) for a metal that experiences both elas¬ 
tic and plastic deformation. Assume Equation 


6.5 for elastic deformation, that the modulus 
of elasticity is 172 GPa (25 X 10 6 psi), and that 
elastic deformation terminates at a strain of 
0.01. For plastic deformation, assume that the 
relationship between stress and strain is de¬ 
scribed by Equation 6.19, in which the values 
for K and n are 6900 MPa (1 X 10 6 psi) and 
0.30, respectively. Furthermore, plastic defor¬ 
mation occurs between strain values of 0.01 
and 0.75, at which point fracture occurs. 

6.47 For a tensile test, it can be demonstrated that 
necking begins when 


Using Equation 6.19, determine the value of 
the true strain at this onset of necking. 

6.48 Taking the logarithm of both sides of Equa¬ 
tion 6.19 yields 

log cr T = logK + n\oge T (6.27) 

Thus, a plot of log a T versus log e T in the plas¬ 
tic region to the point of necking should yield 
a straight line having a slope of n and an in¬ 
tercept (at log cr T = 0) of log K. 

Using the appropriate data tabulated in 
Problem 6.29, make a plot of log a T versus 
log e T and determine the values of n and K. 
It will be necessary to convert engineering 
stresses and strains to true stresses and strains 
using Equations 6.18a and 6.18b.

A completely formed beverage can is shown in Figure (c). Fabrication 
of this can is accomplished by a series of deep drawing operations during 
which the walls of the can are plastically deformed (i.e., are 
stretched). The grains of aluminum in these walls change 
shape—that is, they elongate in the direction of stretching. The 
resulting grain structure would appear similar to that shown in

WHY STUDY Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms? 


With a knowledge of the nature of dislocations and 
the role they play in the plastic deformation process, 
we are able to understand the underlying mechanisms 
of the techniques that are used to strengthen and 
harden metals and their alloys. Thus, it becomes possi¬ 
ble to design and tailor the mechanical properties of 
materials—for example, the strength or toughness of a 
metal—matrix composite. 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying dislocations and strength¬ 
ening mechanisms are as follows: 


• Strengthening mechanisms discussed in this chapter 
will be applied to the development of mechanical 
properties for steel alloys (Chapter 10). 

• We also discuss (in terms of dislocations) why heat- 
treating a deformed metal alloy makes it softer and 
more ductile and produces changes in its 
microstructure. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe edge and screw dislocation motion 
from an atomic perspective. 

2. Describe how plastic deformation occurs by the 
motion of edge and screw dislocations in res¬ 
ponse to applied shear stresses. 

3. Define slip system and cite one example. 

4. Describe how the grain structure of a polycrys¬ 
talline metal is altered when it is plastically 
deformed. 

5. Explain how grain boundaries impede dislocation 
motion and why a metal having small grains is 
stronger than one having large grains. 


6. Describe and explain solid-solution strengthening 
for substitutional impurity atoms in terms of 
lattice strain interactions with dislocations. 

7. Describe and explain the phenomenon of strain 
hardening (or cold working) in terms of disloca¬ 
tions and strain field interactions. 

8. Describe recrystallization in terms of both the 
alteration of microstructure and mechanical 
characteristics of the material. 

9. Describe the phenomenon of grain growth from 
both macroscopic and atomic perspectives. 


7.1 INTRODUCTION 

Chapter 6 explained that materials may experience two kinds of deformation: elas¬ 
tic and plastic. Plastic deformation is permanent, and strength and hardness are 
measures of a material’s resistance to this deformation. On a microscopic scale, plas¬ 
tic deformation corresponds to the net movement of large numbers of atoms in 
response to an applied stress. During this process, interatomic bonds must be rup¬ 
tured and then re-formed. In crystalline solids, plastic deformation most often in¬ 
volves the motion of dislocations, linear crystalline defects that were introduced in 
Section 4.5. This chapter discusses the characteristics of dislocations and their in¬ 
volvement in plastic deformation. Twinning, another process by which some metals 
plastically deform, is also treated. In addition, and probably most importantly, sev¬ 
eral techniques are presented for strengthening single-phase metals, the mechanisms 
of which are described in terms of dislocations. Finally, the latter sections of this 
chapter are concerned with recovery and recrystallization—processes that occur in 
plastically deformed metals, normally at elevated temperatures —and, in addition, 
grain growth.

7.2 Basic Concepts * 199 


Dislocations and Plastic Deformation 


Early materials studies led to the computation of the theoretical strengths of per¬ 
fect crystals, which were many times greater than those actually measured. During 
the 1930s it was theorized that this discrepancy in mechanical strengths could be 
explained by a type of linear crystalline defect that has since come to be known as 
a dislocation. Not until the 1950s, however, was the existence of such dislocation de¬ 
fects established by direct observation with the electron microscope. Since then, a 
theory of dislocations has evolved that explains many of the physical and mechan¬ 
ical phenomena in metals [as well as crystalline ceramics (Section 12.10)]. 


7.2 BASIC CONCEPTS 


VMSE 



Edge 


Edge and screw are the two fundamental dislocation types. In an edge dislocation, 
localized lattice distortion exists along the end of an extra half-plane of atoms, which 
also defines the dislocation line (Figure 4.3). A screw dislocation may be thought of 
as resulting from shear distortion; its dislocation line passes through the center of a 
spiral, atomic plane ramp (Figure 4.4). Many dislocations in crystalline materials have 
both edge and screw components; these are mixed dislocations (Figure 4.5). 

Plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations. 
An edge dislocation moves in response to a shear stress applied in a direction 
perpendicular to its line; the mechanics of dislocation motion are represented in 
Figure 7.1. Let the initial extra half-plane of atoms be plane A. When the shear 
stress is applied as indicated (Figure 7.1a), plane A is forced to the right; this in turn 
pushes the top halves of planes B , C, D , and so on, in the same direction. If the 
applied shear stress is of sufficient magnitude, the interatomic bonds of plane B are 
severed along the shear plane, and the upper half of plane B becomes the extra 
half-plane as plane A links up with the bottom half of plane B (Figure 7.1 b). This 
process is subsequently repeated for the other planes, such that the extra half-plane, 
by discrete steps, moves from left to right by successive and repeated breaking of

bonds and shifting by interatomic distances of upper half-planes. Before and after 
the movement of a dislocation through some particular region of the crystal, the 
atomic arrangement is ordered and perfect; it is only during the passage of the ex¬ 
tra half-plane that the lattice structure is disrupted. Ultimately this extra half-plane 
may emerge from the right surface of the crystal, forming an edge that is one atomic 
distance wide; this is shown in Figure 7.1c. 

The process by which plastic deformation is produced by dislocation motion 
is termed slip; the crystallographic plane along which the dislocation line trav¬ 
erses is the slip plane, as indicated in Figure 7.1. Macroscopic plastic deformation 
simply corresponds to permanent deformation that results from the movement 
of dislocations, or slip, in response to an applied shear stress, as represented in 
Figure 1.2a. 

Dislocation motion is analogous to the mode of locomotion employed by a 
caterpillar (Figure 7.3). The caterpillar forms a hump near its posterior end by 
pulling in its last pair of legs a unit leg distance. The hump is propelled forward by 
repeated lifting and shifting of leg pairs. When the hump reaches the anterior end, 
the entire caterpillar has moved forward by the leg separation distance. The cater¬ 
pillar hump and its motion correspond to the extra half-plane of atoms in the dis¬ 
location model of plastic deformation. 

The motion of a screw dislocation in response to the applied shear stress is 
shown in Figure 12b\ the direction of movement is perpendicular to the stress di¬ 
rection. For an edge, motion is parallel to the shear stress. However, the net plastic 
deformation for the motion of both dislocation types is the same (see Figure 7.2). 
The direction of motion of the mixed dislocation line is neither perpendicular nor 
parallel to the applied stress, but lies somewhere in between. 

All metals and alloys contain some dislocations that were introduced during 
solidification, during plastic deformation, and as a consequence of thermal stresses 
that result from rapid cooling. The number of dislocations, or dislocation density in 
a material, is expressed as the total dislocation length per unit volume or, equiva¬ 
lently, the number of dislocations that intersect a unit area of a random section. The

units of dislocation density are millimeters of dislocation per cubic millimeter or 
just per square millimeter. Dislocation densities as low as 10 3 mm -2 are typically 
found in carefully solidified metal crystals. For heavily deformed metals, the den¬ 
sity may run as high as 10 9 to 10 10 mm -2 . Heat-treating a deformed metal specimen 
can diminish the density to on the order of 10 5 to 10 6 mm -2 . By way of contrast, a 
typical dislocation density for ceramic materials is between 10 2 and 10 4 mm -2 ; also, 
for silicon single crystals used in integrated circuits the value normally lies between 
0.1 and 1 mm -2 . 

7.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF DISLOCATIONS 

Several characteristics of dislocations are important with regard to the mechanical 
properties of metals. These include strain fields that exist around dislocations, which 
are influential in determining the mobility of the dislocations, as well as their abil¬ 
ity to multiply. 

When metals are plastically deformed, some fraction of the deformation energy 
(approximately 5%) is retained internally; the remainder is dissipated as heat. The 
major portion of this stored energy is as strain energy associated with dislocations. 
Consider the edge dislocation represented in Figure 7.4. As already mentioned, some 
atomic lattice distortion exists around the dislocation line because of the presence 
of the extra half-plane of atoms. As a consequence, there are regions in which corn- 

lattice strain pressive, tensile, and shear lattice strains are imposed on the neighboring atoms. For 

example, atoms immediately above and adjacent to the dislocation line are squeezed 
together. As a result, these atoms may be thought of as experiencing a compressive 
strain relative to atoms positioned in the perfect crystal and far removed from the 
dislocation; this is illustrated in Figure 7.4. Directly below the half-plane, the effect 
is just the opposite; lattice atoms sustain an imposed tensile strain, which is as shown. 
Shear strains also exist in the vicinity of the edge dislocation. For a screw disloca¬ 
tion, lattice strains are pure shear only. These lattice distortions may be considered

to be strain fields that radiate from the dislocation line. The strains extend into the 
surrounding atoms, and their magnitude decreases with radial distance from the dis¬ 
location. 

The strain fields surrounding dislocations in close proximity to one another may 
interact such that forces are imposed on each dislocation by the combined interac¬ 
tions of all its neighboring dislocations. For example, consider two edge dislocations 
that have the same sign and the identical slip plane, as represented in Figure 1.5a. 
The compressive and tensile strain fields for both lie on the same side of the slip 
plane; the strain field interaction is such that there exists between these two iso¬ 
lated dislocations a mutual repulsive force that tends to move them apart. On the 
other hand, two dislocations of opposite sign and having the same slip plane will 
be attracted to one another, as indicated in Figure 7.56, and dislocation annihila¬ 
tion will occur when they meet. That is, the two extra half-planes of atoms will align 
and become a complete plane. Dislocation interactions are possible between edge, 
screw, and/or mixed dislocations, and for a variety of orientations. These strain fields 
and associated forces are important in the strengthening mechanisms for metals. 

During plastic deformation, the number of dislocations increases dramatically. 
We know that the dislocation density in a metal that has been highly deformed may 
be as high as 10 10 mm -2 . One important source of these new dislocations is exist¬ 
ing dislocations, which multiply; furthermore, grain boundaries, as well as internal 
defects and surface irregularities such as scratches and nicks, which act as stress con¬ 
centrations, may serve as dislocation formation sites during deformation. 

7.4 SLIP SYSTEMS 

Dislocations do not move with the same degree of ease on all crystallographic planes 
of atoms and in all crystallographic directions. Ordinarily there is a preferred plane, 
and in that plane there are specific directions along which dislocation motion occurs. 
This plane is called the slip plane; it follows that the direction of movement is called 
the slip direction. This combination of the slip plane and the slip direction is termed 

slip system the slip system. The slip system depends on the crystal structure of the metal and 

is such that the atomic distortion that accompanies the motion of a dislocation is a

minimum. For a particular crystal structure, the slip plane is the plane that has the 
most dense atomic packing—that is, has the greatest planar density. The slip direc¬ 
tion corresponds to the direction, in this plane, that is most closely packed with 
atoms—that is, has the highest linear density. Planar and linear atomic densities 
were discussed in Section 3.11. 

Consider, for example, the FCC crystal structure, a unit cell of which is shown 
in Figure 1.6a. There is a set of planes, the {111} family, all of which are closely 
packed. A (lll)-type plane is indicated in the unit cell; in Figure 1.6b, this plane is 
positioned within the plane of the page, in which atoms are now represented as 
touching nearest neighbors. 

Slip occurs along (llO)-type directions within the {111} planes, as indicated by 
arrows in Figure 7.6. Hence, {111}(110) represents the slip plane and direction com¬ 
bination, or the slip system for FCC. Figure 1.6b demonstrates that a given slip plane 
may contain more than a single slip direction. Thus, several slip systems may exist 
for a particular crystal structure; the number of independent slip systems represents 
the different possible combinations of slip planes and directions. For example, for 
face-centered cubic, there are 12 slip systems: four unique {111} planes and, within 
each plane, three independent (llO) directions. 

The possible slip systems for BCC and HCP crystal structures are listed in Table 
7.1. For each of these structures, slip is possible on more than one family of planes 
(e.g., {110}, {211}, and {321} for BCC). For metals having these two crystal struc¬ 
tures, some slip systems are often operable only at elevated temperatures.

204 * Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms 


Metals with FCC or BCC crystal structures have a relatively large number of 
slip systems (at least 12). These metals are quite ductile because extensive plastic 
deformation is normally possible along the various systems. Conversely, HCP met¬ 
als, having few active slip systems, are normally quite brittle. 

The Burgers vector concept was introduced in Section 4.5, and denoted by a b 
for edge, screw, and mixed dislocations in Figures 4.3,4.4, and 4.5, respectively. With 
regard to the process of slip, a Burgers vector’s direction corresponds to a disloca¬ 
tion’s slip direction, whereas its magnitude is equal to the unit slip distance (or 
interatomic separation in this direction). Of course, both the direction and the mag¬ 
nitude of b will depend on crystal structure, and it is convenient to specify a Burgers 
vector in terms of unit cell edge length ( a ) and crystallographic direction indices. 
Burgers vectors for face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close- 
packed crystal structures are given as follows:

7.5 SLIP IN SINGLE CRYSTALS 

A further explanation of slip is simplified by treating the process in single crystals, 
then making the appropriate extension to polycrystalline materials. As mentioned 
previously, edge, screw, and mixed dislocations move in response to shear stresses 
applied along a slip plane and in a slip direction. As noted in Section 6.2, even 
though an applied stress may be pure tensile (or compressive), shear components 
exist at all but parallel or perpendicular alignments to the stress direction (Equa- 
resolved shear stress tion 6.4b). These are termed resolved shear stresses, and their magnitudes depend 
not only on the applied stress, but also on the orientation of both the slip plane and 
direction within that plane. Let <p represent the angle between the normal to the 
slip plane and the applied stress direction, and A the angle between the slip and 
stress directions, as indicated in Figure 7.7; it can then be shown that for the re¬ 
solved shear stress t r

where a is the applied stress. In general, <fi + A =£ 90°, because it need not be the 
case that the tensile axis, the slip plane normal, and the slip direction all lie in the

A metal single crystal has a number of different slip systems that are capable 
of operating. The resolved shear stress normally differs for each one because the 
orientation of each relative to the stress axis and A angles) also differs. How¬ 
ever, one slip system is generally oriented most favorably—that is, has the largest

reaches some critical value, termed the critical resolved shear stress T crss ; it repre¬ 
sents the minimum shear stress required to initiate slip and is a property of the ma¬ 
terial that determines when yielding occurs. The single crystal plastically deforms 
or yields when (max) = T crss , and the magnitude of the applied stress required to 
initiate yielding (i.e., the yield strength cr y ) is

For a single-crystal specimen that is stressed in tension, deformation will be as 
in Figure 7.8, where slip occurs along a number of equivalent and most favorably 
oriented planes and directions at various positions along the specimen length. This 
slip deformation forms as small steps on the surface of the single crystal that are

parallel to one another and loop around the circumference of the specimen as in¬ 
dicated in Figure 7.8. Each step results from the movement of a large number of 
dislocations along the same slip plane. On the surface of a polished single-crystal 
specimen, these steps appear as lines, which are called slip lines. A zinc single crys¬ 
tal that has been plastically deformed to the degree that these slip markings are 
discernible is shown in Figure 7.9. 

With continued extension of a single crystal, both the number of slip lines and 
the slip step width will increase. For FCC and BCC metals, slip may eventually be¬ 
gin along a second slip system, the system that is next most favorably oriented with 
the tensile axis. Furthermore, for HCP crystals having few slip systems, if the stress 
axis for the most favorable slip system is either perpendicular to the slip direction 
(A = 90°) or parallel to the slip plane (0 = 90°), the critical resolved shear stress 
will be zero. For these extreme orientations the crystal ordinarily fractures rather 
than deforming plastically.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 7.1 

Resolved Shear Stress and Stress-to-lnitiate-Yielding 
Computations 

Consider a single crystal of BCC iron oriented such that a tensile stress is 
applied along a [010] direction. 

(a) Compute the resolved shear stress along a (110) plane and in a [Til] 
direction when a tensile stress of 52 MPa (7500 psi) is applied. 

(b) If slip occurs on a (110) plane and in a [Til] direction, and the critical 
resolved shear stress is 30 MPa (4350 psi), calculate the magnitude of the 
applied tensile stress necessary to initiate yielding. 

Solution 

(a) A BCC unit cell along with the slip direction and plane as well as the 
direction of the applied stress are shown in the accompanying diagram. In 
order to solve this problem we must use Equation 7.2. However, it is first nec¬ 
essary to determine values for <f> and A, where, from the preceding diagram, 
4> is the angle between the normal to the (110) slip plane (i.e., the [110] 
direction) and the [010] direction, and A represents the angle between the [Til] 
and [010] directions. In general, for cubic unit cells, an angle 6 between 
directions 1 and 2, represented by [zqv^] and [u 2 v 2 w 2 ], respectively, is equal to

7.6 PLASTIC DEFORMATION OF 
POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS 

Deformation and slip in polycrystalline materials is somewhat more complex. 
Because of the random crystallographic orientations of the numerous grains, 
the direction of slip varies from one grain to another. For each, dislocation 
motion occurs along the slip system that has the most favorable orientation, 
as defined earlier. This is exemplified by a photomicrograph of a polycrys¬ 
talline copper specimen that has been plastically deformed (Figure 7.10); be¬ 
fore deformation the surface was polished. Slip lines 1 are visible, and it ap¬ 
pears that two slip systems operated for most of the grains, as evidenced by 
two sets of parallel yet intersecting sets of lines. Furthermore, variation in grain 
orientation is indicated by the difference in alignment of the slip lines for the 
several grains. 


1 These slip lines are microscopic ledges produced by dislocations (Figure 7.1c) that have 
exited from a grain and appear as lines when viewed with a microscope. They are analo¬ 
gous to the macroscopic steps found on the surfaces of deformed single crystals (Figures 
7.8 and 7.9).

Gross plastic deformation of a polycrystalline specimen corresponds to the com¬ 
parable distortion of the individual grains by means of slip. During deformation, 
mechanical integrity and coherency are maintained along the grain boundaries; that 
is, the grain boundaries usually do not come apart or open up. As a consequence, 
each individual grain is constrained, to some degree, in the shape it may assume by 
its neighboring grains. The manner in which grains distort as a result of gross plas¬ 
tic deformation is indicated in Figure 7.11. Before deformation the grains are 
equiaxed, or have approximately the same dimension in all directions. For this par¬ 
ticular deformation, the grains become elongated along the direction in which the 
specimen was extended. 

Polycrystalline metals are stronger than their single-crystal equivalents, which 
means that greater stresses are required to initiate slip and the attendant yielding. 
This is, to a large degree, also a result of geometrical constraints that are imposed 
on the grains during deformation. Even though a single grain may be favorably

oriented with the applied stress for slip, it cannot deform until the adjacent and 
less favorably oriented grains are capable of slip also; this requires a higher ap¬ 
plied stress level. 


7.7 DEFORMATION BY TWINNING 

In addition to slip, plastic deformation in some metallic materials can occur by 
the formation of mechanical twins, or twinning. The concept of a twin was in¬ 
troduced in Section 4.6; that is, a shear force can produce atomic displacements 
such that on one side of a plane (the twin boundary), atoms are located in mirror- 
image positions of atoms on the other side. The manner in which this is accom¬ 
plished is demonstrated in Figure 7.12. Here, open circles represent atoms that 
did not move, and dashed and solid circles represent original and final positions,

respectively, of atoms within the twinned region. As may be noted in this figure, 
the displacement magnitude within the twin region (indicated by arrows) is pro¬ 
portional to the distance from the twin plane. Furthermore, twinning occurs on 
a definite crystallographic plane and in a specific direction that depend on crys¬ 
tal structure. For example, for BCC metals, the twin plane and direction are (112) 
and [111], respectively. 

Slip and twinning deformations are compared in Figure 7.13 for a single crys¬ 
tal that is subjected to a shear stress r. Slip ledges are shown in Figure 7.13a, the 
formation of which was described in Section 7.5; for twinning, the shear deforma¬ 
tion is homogeneous (Figure 1.13b). These two processes differ from each other in 
several respects. First, for slip, the crystallographic orientation above and below the 
slip plane is the same both before and after the deformation; for twinning, there 
will be a reorientation across the twin plane. In addition, slip occurs in distinct atomic 
spacing multiples, whereas the atomic displacement for twinning is less than the in¬ 
teratomic separation. 

Mechanical twinning occurs in metals that have BCC and HCP crystal struc¬ 
tures, at low temperatures, and at high rates of loading (shock loading), conditions 
under which the slip process is restricted; that is, there are few operable slip sys¬ 
tems. The amount of bulk plastic deformation from twinning is normally small rel¬ 
ative to that resulting from slip. However, the real importance of twinning lies with 
the accompanying crystallographic reorientations; twinning may place new slip sys¬ 
tems in orientations that are favorable relative to the stress axis such that the slip 
process can now take place. 

Mechanisms of Strengthening in Metals 

Metallurgical and materials engineers are often called on to design alloys having high 
strengths yet some ductility and toughness; ordinarily, ductility is sacrificed when an 
alloy is strengthened. Several hardening techniques are at the disposal of an engineer, 
and frequently alloy selection depends on the capacity of a material to be tailored 
with the mechanical characteristics required for a particular application. 

Important to the understanding of strengthening mechanisms is the relation be¬ 
tween dislocation motion and mechanical behavior of metals. Because macroscopic 
plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of large numbers of dislocations, the 
ability of a metal to plastically deform depends on the ability of dislocations to move. 
Because hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) are related to the ease with 
which plastic deformation can be made to occur, by reducing the mobility of 















212 * Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms 

dislocations, the mechanical strength may be enhanced; that is, greater mechanical 
forces will be required to initiate plastic deformation. In contrast, the more uncon¬ 
strained the dislocation motion, the greater is the facility with which a metal may 
deform, and the softer and weaker it becomes. Virtually all strengthening techniques 
rely on this simple principle: Restricting or hindering dislocation motion renders a 
material harder and stronger. 

The present discussion is confined to strengthening mechanisms for single-phase 
metals by grain size reduction, solid-solution alloying, and strain hardening. Defor¬ 
mation and strengthening of multiphase alloys are more complicated, involving con¬ 
cepts beyond the scope of the present discussion; Chapter 10 and Section 11.9 treat 
techniques that are used to strengthen multiphase alloys. 

7.8 STRENGTHENING BY GRAIN SIZE REDUCTION 

The size of the grains, or average grain diameter, in a polycrystalline metal influences 
the mechanical properties. Adjacent grains normally have different crystallographic 
orientations and, of course, a common grain boundary, as indicated in Figure 7.14. 
During plastic deformation, slip or dislocation motion must take place across this 
common boundary—say, from grain A to grain B in Figure 7.14. The grain boundary 
acts as a barrier to dislocation motion for two reasons: 

1. Because the two grains are of different orientations, a dislocation passing into 
grain B will have to change its direction of motion; this becomes more diffi¬ 
cult as the crystallographic misorientation increases. 

2. The atomic disorder within a grain boundary region will result in a disconti¬ 
nuity of slip planes from one grain into the other. 

It should be mentioned that, for high-angle grain boundaries, it may not be the 
case that dislocations traverse grain boundaries during deformation; rather, 
dislocations tend to “pile up” (or back up) at grain boundaries. These pile-ups 
introduce stress concentrations ahead of their slip planes, which generate new dis¬ 
locations in adjacent grains. 

A fine-grained material (one that has small grains) is harder and stronger than 
one that is coarse grained, because the former has a greater total grain boundary 
area to impede dislocation motion. For many materials, the yield strength cr y varies 
with grain size according to 


Figure 7.14 The motion of a dislocation as 
it encounters a grain boundary, illustrating 
how the boundary acts as a barrier to 
continued slip. Slip planes are discontinuous 
and change directions across the boundary.

o> = (7 0 + k y d~ m (7.7) 

In this expression, termed the Hall-Petch equation, d is the average grain diame¬ 
ter, and ctq and k y are constants for a particular material. Note that Equation 7.7 is 
not valid for both very large (i.e., coarse) grain and extremely fine grain polycrys¬ 
talline materials. Figure 7.15 demonstrates the yield strength dependence on grain 
size for a brass alloy. Grain size may be regulated by the rate of solidification from 
the liquid phase, and also by plastic deformation followed by an appropriate heat 
treatment, as discussed in Section 7.13. 

It should also be mentioned that grain size reduction improves not only strength, 
but also the toughness of many alloys. 

Small-angle grain boundaries (Section 4.6) are not effective in interfering with 
the slip process because of the slight crystallographic misalignment across the 
boundary. On the other hand, twin boundaries (Section 4.6) will effectively block 
slip and increase the strength of the material. Boundaries between two different 
phases are also impediments to movements of dislocations; this is important in the 
strengthening of more complex alloys. The sizes and shapes of the constituent phases 
significantly affect the mechanical properties of multiphase alloys; these are the top¬ 
ics of discussion in Sections 10.7,10.8, and 16.1. 


7.9 SOLID-SOLUTION STRENGTHENING 

Another technique to strengthen and harden metals is alloying with impurity atoms 
that go into either substitutional or interstitial solid solution. Accordingly, this is 
solid-solution called solid-solution strengthening. High-purity metals are almost always softer and 

strengthening weaker than alloys composed of the same base metal. Increasing the concentration 

of the impurity results in an attendant increase in tensile and yield strengths, as in¬ 
dicated in Figures 7.16a and 1.16b for nickel in copper; the dependence of ductil¬ 
ity on nickel concentration is presented in Figure 7.16c.

VMSE Alloys are stronger than pure metals because impurity atoms that go into solid 


consequently, dislocation movement is restricted. For example, an impurity atom 
that is smaller than a host atom for which it substitutes exerts tensile strains on the 
surrounding crystal lattice, as illustrated in Figure 7.17a. Conversely, a larger 












solution ordinarily impose lattice strains on the surrounding host atoms. Lattice 
strain field interactions between dislocations and these impurity atoms result, and,

substitutional atom imposes compressive strains in its vicinity (Figure 7.18a). These 
solute atoms tend to diffuse to and segregate around dislocations in a way so as to 
reduce the overall strain energy—that is, to cancel some of the strain in the lattice 
surrounding a dislocation. To accomplish this, a smaller impurity atom is located 
where its tensile strain will partially nullify some of the dislocation’s compressive 
strain. For the edge dislocation in Figure 7.176, this would be adjacent to the dis¬ 
location line and above the slip plane. A larger impurity atom would be situated as 
in Figure 7.186. 

The resistance to slip is greater when impurity atoms are present because the 
overall lattice strain must increase if a dislocation is torn away from them. Fur¬ 
thermore, the same lattice strain interactions (Figures 7.176 and 7.186) will exist 
between impurity atoms and dislocations that are in motion during plastic defor¬ 
mation. Thus, a greater applied stress is necessary to first initiate and then continue 
plastic deformation for solid-solution alloys, as opposed to pure metals; this is evi¬ 
denced by the enhancement of strength and hardness. 


7.10 STRAIN HARDENING 


strain hardening 


cold working 


Percent cold work— 
dependence on 
original and 
deformed cross- 
sectional areas 


Strain hardening is the phenomenon whereby a ductile metal becomes harder and 
stronger as it is plastically deformed. Sometimes it is also called work hardening, 
or, because the temperature at which deformation takes place is “cold” relative to 
the absolute melting temperature of the metal, cold working. Most metals strain 
harden at room temperature. 

It is sometimes convenient to express the degree of plastic deformation as per¬ 
cent cold work rather than as strain. Percent cold work (%CW) is defined as 

%CW = ( A ° a x 100 (7.8) 

where A 0 is the original area of the cross section that experiences deformation and 
A d is the area after deformation. 

Figures 7.19a and 7.196 demonstrate how steel, brass, and copper increase in 
yield and tensile strength with increasing cold work. The price for this enhancement 
of hardness and strength is in the ductility of the metal. This is shown in Fig¬ 
ure 7.19c, in which the ductility, in percent elongation, experiences a reduction with 
increasing percent cold work for the same three alloys. The influence of cold work 
on the stress-strain behavior of a low-carbon steel is shown in Figure 7.20; here 
stress-strain curves are plotted at 0%CW, 4%CW, and 24%CW. 

Strain hardening is demonstrated in a stress-strain diagram presented earlier 
(Figure 6.17). Initially, the metal with yield strength a yo is plastically deformed to

The strain-hardening phenomenon is explained on the basis of dislocation- 
dislocation strain field interactions similar to those discussed in Section 7.3. The 
dislocation density in a metal increases with deformation or cold work, because of

dislocation multiplication or the formation of new dislocations, as noted previously. 
Consequently, the average distance of separation between dislocations decreases— 
the dislocations are positioned closer together. On the average, dislocation-dislocation 
strain interactions are repulsive. The net result is that the motion of a dislocation is 
hindered by the presence of other dislocations. As the dislocation density increases, 
this resistance to dislocation motion by other dislocations becomes more pro¬ 
nounced. Thus, the imposed stress necessary to deform a metal increases with in¬ 
creasing cold work. 

Strain hardening is often utilized commercially to enhance the mechanical prop¬ 
erties of metals during fabrication procedures. The effects of strain hardening may 
be removed by an annealing heat treatment, as discussed in Section 11.7. 

In passing, for the mathematical expression relating true stress and strain, Equa¬ 
tion 6.19, the parameter n is called the strain-hardening exponent , which is a meas¬ 
ure of the ability of a metal to strain harden; the larger its magnitude, the greater 
the strain hardening for a given amount of plastic strain.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 7.2 

Tensile Strength and Ductility Determinations for 
Cold-Worked Copper 

Compute the tensile strength and ductility (%EL) of a cylindrical copper rod 
if it is cold worked such that the diameter is reduced from 15.2 mm to 12.2 mm 
(0.60 in. to 0.48 in.). 

Solution 

It is first necessary to determine the percent cold work resulting from the 
deformation. This is possible using Equation 7.8: 

( 15.2 mm V ( 12.2 mmV 

V 2 ) 77 ~ V 2 ) 77 

%CW = --/---— X 100 = 35.6% 

/15.2 mm Y 

V 2 ) 77 

The tensile strength is read directly from the curve for copper (Figure 7.19 b) 
as 340 MPa (50,000 psi). From Figure 7.19c, the ductility at 35.6%CW is about 
7% EL. 


In summary, we have just discussed the three mechanisms that may be used to 
strengthen and harden single-phase metal alloys: strengthening by grain size 
reduction, solid-solution strengthening, and strain hardening. Of course they may 
be used in conjunction with one another; for example, a solid-solution strengthened 
alloy may also be strain hardened. 

It should also be noted that the strengthening effects due to grain size reduc¬ 
tion and strain hardening can be eliminated or at least reduced by an elevated- 
temperature heat treatment (Sections 7.12 and 7.13). Conversely, solid-solution 
strengthening is unaffected by heat treatment. 

Recovery, Recrystallization, 
and Grain Growth 


As outlined earlier in this chapter, plastically deforming a polycrystalline metal spec¬ 
imen at temperatures that are low relative to its absolute melting temperature pro¬ 
duces microstructural and property changes that include (1) a change in grain shape 
(Section 7.6), (2) strain hardening (Section 7.10), and (3) an increase in dislocation 
density (Section 7.3). Some fraction of the energy expended in deformation is stored 
in the metal as strain energy, which is associated with tensile, compressive, and shear 
zones around the newly created dislocations (Section 7.3). Furthermore, other prop¬ 
erties such as electrical conductivity (Section 18.8) and corrosion resistance may be 
modified as a consequence of plastic deformation. 

These properties and structures may revert back to the precold-worked states 
by appropriate heat treatment (sometimes termed an annealing treatment ). Such 
restoration results from two different processes that occur at elevated temperatures: 
recovery and recrystallization, which may be followed by grain growth. 












7.12 Recrystallization * 219 


7.11 RECOVERY 

recovery During recovery, some of the stored internal strain energy is relieved by virtue of dis¬ 

location motion (in the absence of an externally applied stress), as a result of enhanced 
atomic diffusion at the elevated temperature. There is some reduction in the number 
of dislocations, and dislocation configurations (similar to that shown in Figure 4.8) are 
produced having low strain energies. In addition, physical properties such as electrical 
and thermal conductivities are recovered to their precold-worked states. 

7.12 RECRYSTALLIZATION 

Even after recovery is complete, the grains are still in a relatively high strain en- 
recrystallization ergy state. Recrystallization is the formation of a new set of strain-free and equiaxed 

grains (i.e., having approximately equal dimensions in all directions) that have low 
dislocation densities and are characteristic of the precold-worked condition. The 
driving force to produce this new grain structure is the difference in internal en¬ 
ergy between the strained and unstrained material. The new grains form as very 
small nuclei and grow until they completely consume the parent material, processes 
that involve short-range diffusion. Several stages in the recrystallization process 
are represented in Figures 7.21a to 7.21J; in these photomicrographs, the small 
speckled grains are those that have recrystallized. Thus, recrystallization of cold- 
worked metals may be used to refine the grain structure. 

Also, during recrystallization, the mechanical properties that were changed as 
a result of cold working are restored to their precold-worked values; that is, the 
metal becomes softer and weaker, yet more ductile. Some heat treatments are 
designed to allow recrystallization to occur with these modifications in the 
mechanical characteristics (Section 11.7). 

Recrystallization is a process the extent of which depends on both time and tem¬ 
perature. The degree (or fraction) of recrystallization increases with time, as may be 
noted in the photomicrographs shown in Figures 7.21 a-d. The explicit time depend¬ 
ence of recrystallization is addressed in more detail near the end of Section 10.3. 

The influence of temperature is demonstrated in Figure 7.22, which plots ten¬ 
sile strength and ductility (at room temperature) of a brass alloy as a function of 
the temperature and for a constant heat treatment time of 1 h. The grain structures 
found at the various stages of the process are also presented schematically. 

The recrystallization behavior of a particular metal alloy is sometimes specified 
recrystallization in terms of a recrystallization temperature, the temperature at which recrystalliza- 

temperature tion just reaches completion in 1 h. Thus, the recrystallization temperature for the 

brass alloy of Figure 7.22 is about 450°C (850°F). Typically, it is between one-third 
and one-half of the absolute melting temperature of a metal or alloy and depends 
on several factors, including the amount of prior cold work and the purity of the 
alloy. Increasing the percentage of cold work enhances the rate of recrystallization, 
with the result that the recrystallization temperature is lowered, and approaches a 
constant or limiting value at high deformations; this effect is shown in Figure 7.23. 
Furthermore, it is this limiting or minimum recrystallization temperature that is 
normally specified in the literature. There exists some critical degree of cold work 
below which recrystallization cannot be made to occur, as shown in the figure; 
normally, this is between 2% and 20% cold work. 

Recrystallization proceeds more rapidly in pure metals than in alloys. During 
recrystallization, grain-boundary motion occurs as the new grain nuclei form and 
then grow. It is believed that impurity atoms preferentially segregate at and interact 
with these recrystallized grain boundaries so as to diminish their (i.e., grain bound-

recrystallization temperature, sometimes quite substantially. For pure metals, the re¬ 
crystallization temperature is normally 0.4 T m , where T m is the absolute melting tem¬

Plastic deformation operations are often carried out at temperatures above the 
recrystallization temperature in a process termed hot working, described in Section 
11.4. The material remains relatively soft and ductile during deformation because 
it does not strain harden, and thus large deformations are possible.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 7.1 


Description of Diameter Reduction Procedure 


A cylindrical rod of noncold-worked brass having an initial diameter of 6.4 mm 
(0.25 in.) is to be cold worked by drawing such that the cross-sectional area is 
reduced. It is required to have a cold-worked yield strength of at least 345 MPa 
(50,000 psi) and a ductility in excess of 20% EL; in addition, a final diameter of 
5.1 mm (0.20 in.) is necessary. Describe the manner in which this procedure may 
be carried out. 


Solution 


Let us first consider the consequences (in terms of yield strength and ductility) of 
cold working in which the brass specimen diameter is reduced from 6.4 mm (des¬ 
ignated by d 0 ) to 5.1 mm (cQ. The %CW may be computed from Equation 7.8 as

X 100 = 36.5%CW 


From Figures 7.19a and 7.19c, a yield strength of 410 MPa (60,000 psi) and a duc¬ 
tility of 8% EL are attained from this deformation. According to the stipulated 
criteria, the yield strength is satisfactory; however, the ductility is too low. 

Another processing alternative is a partial diameter reduction, followed by 
a recrystallization heat treatment in which the effects of the cold work are nul¬ 
lified. The required yield strength, ductility, and diameter are achieved through 
a second drawing step. 

Again, reference to Figure 7.19a indicates that 20%CW is required to give a 
yield strength of 345 MPa. On the other hand, from Figure 7.19c, ductilities greater 
than 20% EL are possible only for deformations of 23%CW or less. Thus during 
the final drawing operation, deformation must be between 20% CW and 23%CW. 
Let’s take the average of these extremes, 21.5 %CW, and then calculate the final 
diameter for the first drawing d[ h which becomes the original diameter for the sec¬ 
ond drawing. Again, using Equation 7.8,

Now, solving for d' 0 from the preceding expression gives 


d' 0 = 5.8 mm (0.226 in.)

For grain growth, 
dependence of grain 
size on time 


/ Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms 

GROWTH 

After recrystallization is complete, the strain-free grains will continue to grow if the 
metal specimen is left at the elevated temperature (Figures 7.21 d-f); this phenom¬ 
enon is called grain growth. Grain growth does not need to be preceded by recov¬ 
ery and recrystallization; it may occur in all polycrystalline materials, metals and 
ceramics alike. 

An energy is associated with grain boundaries, as explained in Section 4.6. As 
grains increase in size, the total boundary area decreases, yielding an attendant re¬ 
duction in the total energy; this is the driving force for grain growth. 

Grain growth occurs by the migration of grain boundaries. Obviously, not all 
grains can enlarge, but large ones grow at the expense of small ones that shrink. 
Thus, the average grain size increases with time, and at any particular instant 
there will exist a range of grain sizes. Boundary motion is just the short-range 
diffusion of atoms from one side of the boundary to the other. The directions of 
boundary movement and atomic motion are opposite to each other, as shown in 
Figure 7.24. 

For many polycrystalline materials, the grain diameter d varies with time t ac¬ 
cording to the relationship 


d n - d n 0 = Kt (7.9) 

where d 0 is the initial grain diameter at t = 0, and K and n are time-independent 
constants; the value of n is generally equal to or greater than 2. 

The dependence of grain size on time and temperature is demonstrated in 
Figure 7.25, a plot of the logarithm of grain size as a function of the logarithm of 
time for a brass alloy at several temperatures. At lower temperatures the curves are 
linear. Furthermore, grain growth proceeds more rapidly as temperature increases; 
that is, the curves are displaced upward to larger grain sizes. This is explained by 
the enhancement of diffusion rate with rising temperature.

Time (min) 
(Logarithmic scale) 


The mechanical properties at room temperature of a fine-grained metal are 
usually superior (i.e., higher strength and toughness) to those of coarse-grained ones. 
If the grain structure of a single-phase alloy is coarser than that desired, refinement 
may be accomplished by plastically deforming the material, then subjecting it to a 
recrystallization heat treatment, as described previously. 


SUMMARY 


Basic Concepts 

• On a microscopic level, plastic deformation corresponds to the motion of dislo¬ 
cations in response to an externally applied shear stress. An edge dislocation 
moves by the successive and repeated breaking of atomic bonds and shifting by 
interatomic distances of half planes of atoms. 

• For edge dislocations, dislocation line motion and direction of the applied shear 
stress are parallel; for screw dislocations these directions are perpendicular. 

• Dislocation density is the total dislocation length per unit volume of material. Its 
units are per square millimeter. 

• For an edge dislocation, tensile, compressive, and shear strains exist in the 
vicinity of the dislocation line. Shear lattice strains only are found for pure screw 
dislocations. 

Slip Systems 

• The motion of dislocations in response to an externally applied shear stress is 
termed slip. 

• Slip occurs on specific crystallographic planes and within these planes only in cer¬ 
tain directions. A slip system represents a slip plane-slip direction combination. 

• Operable slip systems depend on the crystal structure of the material. The slip 
plane is that plane that has the densest atomic packing, and the slip direction is 
the direction within this plane that is most closely packed with atoms. 

• The slip system for the FCC crystal structure is {111}(110); for BCC several are 
possible: {110}(111>, {211}(111), and {321}(111). 




226 * Chapter 7 / Dislocations and Strengthening Mechanisms 

Slip in Single Crystals 

• Resolved shear stress is the shear stress resulting from an applied tensile stress 
that is resolved onto a plane that is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the stress 
direction. Its value is dependent on the applied stress and orientations of plane 
and direction according to Equation 7.2. 

• The critical resolved shear stress is the minimum resolved shear stress required 
to initiate dislocation motion (or slip) and depends on yield strength and orien¬ 
tation of slip components per Equation 7.4. 

• For a single crystal that is pulled in tension, small steps form on the surface that 
are parallel and loop around the circumference of the specimen. 


Plastic Deformation of Polycrystalline Materials 

• For polycrystalline materials, slip occurs within each grain along those slip systems 
that are most favorably oriented with the applied stress. Furthermore, during 
deformation, grains change shape and extend in those directions wherein there 
is gross plastic deformation. 


Deformation by Twinning 

• Under some circumstances, limited plastic deformation may occur in BCC and 
HCP metals by mechanical twinning. The application of a shear force produces 
slight atomic displacements such that on one side of a plane (i.e., a twin bound¬ 
ary) atoms are located in mirror-image positions of atoms on the other side. 


Mechanisms of Strengthening in Metals 

• The ease with which a material is capable of plastic deformation is a function of 
dislocation mobility—that is, restricting dislocation motion leads to increases 
hardness and strength. 


Strengthening by Grain Size Reduction 

• Grain boundaries are barriers to dislocation motion for two reasons: 

When crossing a grain boundary, a dislocation’s direction of motion must 
change. 

There is a discontinuity of slip planes within the vicinity of a grain boundary. 

• A metal that has small grains will be stronger than one with large grains because 
the former has more grain boundary area, and, thus, more barriers to dislocation 
motion. 

• For most metals, yield strength depends on average grain diameter according to 
the Hall-Petch equation, Equation 7.7. 


Solid-Solution Strengthening 

• The strength and hardness of a metal increase with increase of concentration of 
impurity atoms that go into solid solution (both substitutional and interstitial). 

• Solid-solution strengthening results from lattice strain interactions between 
impurity atoms and dislocations; these interactions produce a diminishment in 
dislocation mobility. 


Summary * 227 


Strain Hardening 

• Strain hardening is just the enhancement in strength (and decrease of ductility) 
of a metal as it is plastically deformed. 

• Degree of plastic deformation may be expressed as percent cold work, which 
depends on original and deformed cross-sectional areas as described by 
Equation 7.8. 

• Yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness of a metal increase with increasing 
percent cold work (Figures 7.19a and 119b)\ ductility diminishes (Figure 7.19c). 

• During plastic deformation dislocation density increases, the average distance be¬ 
tween adjacent dislocations decreases, and—because dislocation-dislocation 
strain field interactions, are, on average, repulsive—dislocation mobility becomes 
more restricted; thus, the metal becomes harder and stronger. 


Recovery 

• During recovery: 

There is some relief of internal strain energy by dislocation motion. 
Dislocation density decreases, and dislocations assume low-energy configu¬ 
rations. 

Some material properties revert back to their precold-worked values. 


Recrystallization 

• During recrystallization: 

A new set of strain-free and equiaxed grains form that have relatively low 
dislocation densities. 

The metal becomes softer, weaker, and more ductile. 

• The driving force for recrystallization is the difference in internal energy between 
strained and recrystallized material. 

• For a cold-worked metal that experiences recrystallization, as temperature in¬ 
creases (at constant heat-treating time), tensile strength decreases and ductility 
increases (per Figure 7.22). 

• The recrystallization temperature of a metal alloy is that temperature at which 
recrystallization reaches completion in one hour. 

• Two factors that influence the recrystallization temperature are percent cold work 
and impurity content. 

Recrystallization temperature diminishes with increasing percent cold work. 

It rises with increasing concentrations of impurities. 

• Plastic deformation of a metal above its recrystallization temperature is hot 
working ; deformation below is termed cold working. 


Grain Growth 

• Grain growth is the increase in average grain size of polycrystalline materials, 
which proceeds by grain boundary motion. 

• The driving force for grain growth is the reduction in total grain boundary 
energy. 

• The time dependence of grain size is represented by Equation 7.9.

Performance Summary 

An understanding of the strengthening mechanisms for metals necessarily requires 
some knowledge concerning (1) the correlation of dislocation motion with plastic 
deformation, (2) the characteristics of these defects (i.e., surrounding strain fields 
and strain-field interactions), and (3) crystallographic aspects (i.e., the concept of 
slip systems). The high hardness (and lack of ductility) of one phase found in steel 
(martensite, Section 10.7) is explained by a solid-solution strengthening effect, and, 
in addition, to the presence of few slip systems. The following diagram represents 
these relationships.

7.12 Consider a metal single crystal oriented such 
that the normal to the slip plane and the slip 
direction are at angles of 43.1° and 47.9°, re¬ 
spectively, with the tensile axis. If the critical 
resolved shear stress is 20.7 MPa (3000 psi), 
will an applied stress of 45 MPa (6500 psi) 
cause the single crystal to yield? If not, what 
stress will be necessary?

the constants cr 0 and k y in Equation 7.7. 

(b) Now predict the yield strength of this 
alloy when the average grain diameter is 
1.0 X 10 -3 mm. 

7.24 The lower yield point for an iron that has an 
average grain diameter of 5 X 10 -2 mm is 135 
MPa (19,500 psi). At a grain diameter of 8 X 
10 -3 mm, the yield point increases to 260 MPa 
(37,500 psi). At what grain diameter will the 
lower yield point be 205 MPa (30,000 psi)? 

7.25 If it is assumed that the plot in Figure 7.15 is 
for noncold-worked brass, determine the 
grain size of the alloy in Figure 7.19; assume 
its composition is the same as the alloy in Fig¬ 
ure 7.15.

briefly explain in terms of lattice strains why 
it would be situated at this position.

in Figure 6.12) when a stress of 400 MPa 
(58,000 psi) is applied. 

7.28 Two previously undeformed cylindrical spec¬ 
imens of an alloy are to be strain hardened by 
reducing their cross-sectional areas (while 
maintaining their circular cross sections). For 
one specimen, the initial and deformed radii 
are 16 mm and 11 mm, respectively. The sec¬ 
ond specimen, with an initial radius of 12 mm,

must have the same deformed hardness as the 
first specimen; compute the second speci¬ 
men’s radius after deformation. 

7.29 Two previously undeformed specimens of the 
same metal are to be plastically deformed by 
reducing their cross-sectional areas. One has 
a circular cross section, and the other is rec¬ 
tangular; during deformation the circular 
cross section is to remain circular, and the rec¬ 
tangular is to remain as such. Their original 
and deformed dimensions are as follows:

its radius before deformation?

(b) What is the approximate Brinell hardness 
of a 1040 steel having a yield strength of 690

7.32 Experimentally, it has been observed for sin¬ 
gle crystals of a number of metals that the crit¬ 
ical resolved shear stress T crss is a function of 
the dislocation density p D as 



where t 0 and A are constants. For copper, the 
critical resolved shear stress is 2.10 MPa (305 
psi) at a dislocation density of 10 5 mm -2 . If it 
is known that the value of A for copper is 6.35

probably have also noticed when 


a small incision (or cut) has been (fr)

is related to one of the basic tenets of fracture mechanics: an applied tensile stress is amplified at the tip of a small incision 
or notch. 

The (b) photograph is of an oil tanker that fractured in a brittle manner as a result of the propagation of a crack completely 
around its girth. This crack started as some type of small notch or sharp flaw. As the tanker was buffeted about while at sea, 
resulting stresses became amplified at the tip of this notch or flaw to the degree that a crack formed and rapidly elongated, 
which ultimately led to complete fracture of the tanker. 

The (c) photograph is of a Boeing 737-200 commercial aircraft (Aloha Airlines flight 243) that experienced an 
explosive decompression and structural failure on April 28, 1988. An investigation of the accident concluded the cause was 
metal fatigue that was aggravated by crevice corrosion (Section 17.7) inasmuch as the plane operated in a coastal (humid and 

salty) environment. Stress cycling of the 
fuselage resulted from compression and 
decompression of the cabin chamber during 
short hop flights. A properly executed main¬ 
tenance program by the airline would have 
detected the fatigue damage and prevented 
this accident. (Photograph of the oil tanker

WHY STUDY Failure? 


The design of a component or structure often calls 
upon the engineer to minimize the possibility of fail¬ 
ure. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanics 
of the various failure modes—fracture, fatigue, and 


creep—and, in addition, be familiar with appropriate 
design principles that may be employed to prevent 
in-service failures. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe the mechanism of crack propagation 
for both ductile and brittle modes of fracture. 

2. Explain why the strengths of brittle materials 
are much lower than predicted by theoretical 
calculations. 

3. Define fracture toughness in terms of (a) a 
brief statement and (b) an equation; define all 
parameters in this equation. 

4. Make a distinction between fracture toughness 
and plane strain fracture toughness. 

5. Name and describe the two impact fracture 
testing techniques. 


6. Define fatigue and specify the conditions under 
which it occurs. 

7. From a fatigue plot for some material, deter¬ 
mine (a) the fatigue lifetime (at a specified 
stress level) and (b) the fatigue strength (at a 
specified number of cycles). 

8. Define creep and specify the conditions under 
which it occurs. 

9. Given a creep plot for some material, determine 
(a) the steady-state creep rate and (b) the 
rupture lifetime. 


8.1 INTRODUCTION 

The failure of engineering materials is almost always an undesirable event for sev¬ 
eral reasons; these include human lives that are put in jeopardy, economic losses, and 
interference with the availability of products and services. Even though the causes 
of failure and the behavior of materials may be known, prevention of failures is dif¬ 
ficult to guarantee. The usual causes are improper materials selection and process¬ 
ing and inadequate design of the component or its misuse. Also, damage can occur 
to structural parts during service, and regular inspection and repair or replacement 
are critical to safe design. It is the responsibility of the engineer to anticipate and 
plan for possible failure and, in the event that failure does occur, to assess its cause 
and then take appropriate preventive measures against future incidents. 

The following topics are addressed in this chapter: simple fracture (both ductile 
and brittle modes), fundamentals of fracture mechanics, fracture toughness testing, 
the ductile-to-brittle transition, fatigue, and creep. These discussions include failure 
mechanisms, testing techniques, and methods by which failure may be prevented or 
controlled.

Fracture 


8.2 FUNDAMENTALS OF FRACTURE 

Simple fracture is the separation of a body into two or more pieces in response to 
an imposed stress that is static (i.e., constant or slowly changing with time) and at 
temperatures that are low relative to the melting temperature of the material. Frac¬ 
ture can also occur from fatigue (when cyclic stresses are imposed) and creep (time- 
dependent deformation, normally at elevated temperatures); the topics of fatigue 
and creep are covered later in this chapter (Sections 8.7 through 8.15). Although ap¬ 
plied stresses may be tensile, compressive, shear, or torsional (or combinations of 
these), the present discussion will be confined to fractures that result from uniaxial 
ductile, brittle tensile loads. For metals, two fracture modes are possible: ductile and brittle. Classi- 

fracture fication is based on the ability of a material to experience plastic deformation. 

Ductile metals typically exhibit substantial plastic deformation with high energy 
absorption before fracture. On the other hand, there is normally little or no plastic 
deformation with low energy absorption accompanying a brittle fracture. The ten¬ 
sile stress-strain behaviors of both fracture types may be reviewed in Figure 6.13. 

Ductile and brittle are relative terms; whether a particular fracture is one mode 
or the other depends on the situation. Ductility may be quantified in terms of per¬ 
cent elongation (Equation 6.11) and percent reduction in area (Equation 6.12). Fur¬ 
thermore, ductility is a function of temperature of the material, the strain rate, and 
the stress state. The disposition of normally ductile materials to fail in a brittle man¬ 
ner is discussed in Section 8.6. 

Any fracture process involves two steps—crack formation and propagation— 
in response to an imposed stress. The mode of fracture is highly dependent on the 
mechanism of crack propagation. Ductile fracture is characterized by extensive plas¬ 
tic deformation in the vicinity of an advancing crack. Furthermore, the process pro¬ 
ceeds relatively slowly as the crack length is extended. Such a crack is often said to 
be stable. That is, it resists any further extension unless there is an increase in the 
applied stress. In addition, there will ordinarily be evidence of appreciable gross de¬ 
formation at the fracture surfaces (e.g., twisting and tearing). On the other hand, 
for brittle fracture, cracks may spread extremely rapidly, with very little accompa¬ 
nying plastic deformation. Such cracks may be said to be unstable , and crack prop¬ 
agation, once started, will continue spontaneously without an increase in magnitude 
of the applied stress. 

Ductile fracture is almost always preferred to brittle for two reasons. First, 
brittle fracture occurs suddenly and catastrophically without any warning; this is 
a consequence of the spontaneous and rapid crack propagation. On the other 
hand, for ductile fracture, the presence of plastic deformation gives warning that 
failure is imminent, allowing preventive measures to be taken. Second, more strain 
energy is required to induce ductile fracture inasmuch as these materials are gen¬ 
erally tougher. Under the action of an applied tensile stress, many metal alloys 
are ductile, whereas ceramics are typically brittle, and polymers may exhibit a 
range of behaviors. 

8.3 DUCTILE FRACTURE 

Ductile fracture surfaces will have their own distinctive features on both macro¬ 
scopic and microscopic levels. Figure 8.1 shows schematic representations for two 
characteristic macroscopic fracture profiles. The configuration shown in Figure 8.1 a 
is found for extremely soft metals, such as pure gold and lead at room temperature,

and other metals, polymers, and inorganic glasses at elevated temperatures. These 
highly ductile materials neck down to a point fracture, showing virtually 100% 
reduction in area. 

The most common type of tensile fracture profile for ductile metals is that rep¬ 
resented in Figure 8.1 b, where fracture is preceded by only a moderate amount of 
necking. The fracture process normally occurs in several stages (Figure 8.2). First, af¬ 
ter necking begins, small cavities, or microvoids, form in the interior of the cross sec¬ 
tion, as indicated in Figure 8.2 b. Next, as deformation continues, these microvoids 
enlarge, come together, and coalesce to form an elliptical crack, which has its long 
axis perpendicular to the stress direction. The crack continues to grow in a direction 
parallel to its major axis by this micro void coalescence process (Figure 8.2c). Finally, 
fracture ensues by the rapid propagation of a crack around the outer perimeter of 
the neck (Figure 8.2 d), by shear deformation at an angle of about 45° with the ten¬ 
sile axis—this is the angle at which the shear stress is a maximum. Sometimes a frac¬ 
ture having this characteristic surface contour is termed a cup-and-cone fracture 
because one of the mating surfaces is in the form of a cup, the other like a cone. In 
this type of fractured specimen (Figure 8.3a), the central interior region of the surface 
has an irregular and fibrous appearance, which is indicative of plastic deformation.

Fractographic Studies 

Much more detailed information regarding the mechanism of fracture is available 
from microscopic examination, normally using scanning electron microscopy. Stud¬ 
ies of this type are termed fractographic. The scanning electron microscope is pre¬ 
ferred for fractographic examinations because it has a much better resolution and 
depth of field than does the optical microscope; these characteristics are necessary 
to reveal the topographical features of fracture surfaces. 

When the fibrous central region of a cup-and-cone fracture surface is examined 
with the electron microscope at a high magnification, it will be found to consist of nu¬ 
merous spherical “dimples” (Figure 8.4a); this structure is characteristic of fracture re¬ 
sulting from uniaxial tensile failure. Each dimple is one half of a microvoid that formed 
and then separated during the fracture process. Dimples also form on the 45° shear lip 
of the cup-and-cone fracture. However, these will be elongated or C-shaped, as shown 
in Figure 8.4Z?. This parabolic shape may be indicative of shear failure. Furthermore, 
other microscopic fracture surface features are also possible. Fractographs such as those 
shown in Figures 8.4a and 8.4Z? provide valuable information in the analyses of frac¬ 
ture, such as the fracture mode, the stress state, and the site of crack initiation. 1

8.4 Brittle Fracture • 239 


8.4 BRITTLE FRACTURE 

Brittle fracture takes place without any appreciable deformation and by rapid crack 
propagation. The direction of crack motion is very nearly perpendicular to the di¬ 
rection of the applied tensile stress and yields a relatively flat fracture surface, as 
indicated in Figure 8.1c. 

Fracture surfaces of materials that failed in a brittle manner will have their own 
distinctive patterns; any signs of gross plastic deformation will be absent. For ex¬ 
ample, in some steel pieces, a series of V-shaped “chevron” markings may form near 
the center of the fracture cross section that point back toward the crack initiation 
site (Figure 8.5a). Other brittle fracture surfaces contain lines or ridges that radiate 
from the origin of the crack in a fanlike pattern (Figure 8.56). Often, both of these

very hard and fine-grained metals, there will be no discernible fracture pattern. Brit¬ 
tle fracture in amorphous materials, such as ceramic glasses, yields a relatively shiny 
and smooth surface. 

For most brittle crystalline materials, crack propagation corresponds to the 
successive and repeated breaking of atomic bonds along specific crystallographic 
planes (Figure 8.6 a); such a process is termed cleavage . This type of fracture is said 
to be transgranular (or transcrystalline), because the fracture cracks pass through

the grains. Microscopically, the fracture surface may have a grainy or faceted tex¬ 
ture (Figure 8.36), as a result of changes in orientation of the cleavage planes from 
grain to grain. This cleavage feature is shown at a higher magnification in the scan¬ 
ning electron micrograph of Figure 8.66. 

In some alloys, crack propagation is along grain boundaries (Figure 8.7 a); 
this fracture is termed intergranular. Figure 8.76 is a scanning electron micro¬ 
graph showing a typical intergranular fracture, in which the three-dimensional

nature of the grains may be seen. This type of fracture normally results subse¬ 
quent to the occurrence of processes that weaken or embrittle grain boundary 
regions. 

8.5 PRINCIPLES OF FRACTURE MECHANICS 

Brittle fracture of normally ductile materials, such as that shown in the chapter¬ 
opening photograph (of the oil barge) for this chapter, has demonstrated the need 
for a better understanding of the mechanisms of fracture. Extensive research 

fracture mechanics endeavors over the past century have led to the evolution of the field of fracture 
mechanics. This subject allows quantification of the relationships between material 
properties, stress level, the presence of crack-producing flaws, and crack propaga¬ 
tion mechanisms. Design engineers are now better equipped to anticipate, and thus 
prevent, structural failures. The present discussion centers on some of the funda¬ 
mental principles of the mechanics of fracture. 

Stress Concentration 

The measured fracture strengths for most materials are significantly lower than 
those predicted by theoretical calculations based on atomic bonding energies. 
This discrepancy is explained by the presence of microscopic flaws or cracks that 
always exist under normal conditions at the surface and within the interior of a 
body of material. These flaws are a detriment to the fracture strength because 
an applied stress may be amplified or concentrated at the tip, the magnitude of 
this amplification depending on crack orientation and geometry. This phenome¬ 
non is demonstrated in Figure 8.8, a stress profile across a cross section con¬ 
taining an internal crack. As indicated by this profile, the magnitude of this 
localized stress diminishes with distance away from the crack tip. At positions 
far removed, the stress is just the nominal stress <x 0 , or the applied load divided

by the specimen cross-sectional area (perpendicular to this load). Because of 
their ability to amplify an applied stress in their locale, these flaws are some¬ 
times called stress raisers. 

If it is assumed that a crack is similar to an elliptical hole through a plate and 
is oriented perpendicular to the applied stress, the maximum stress, <x m , occurs at 
the crack tip and may be approximated by 


(7 


m 



( 8 . 1 ) 


where <t 0 is the magnitude of the nominal applied tensile stress, p t is the radius of 
curvature of the crack tip (Figure 8.8a), and a represents the length of a surface 
crack, or half of the length of an internal crack. For a relatively long microcrack 
that has a small tip radius of curvature, the factor (alp t ) 112 may be very large. This 
will yield a value of <j m that is many times the value of <x 0 . 

Sometimes the ratio cr m la 0 is denoted as the stress concentration factor K t \ 


cr n 


K t = —= 2 



( 8 . 2 ) 


which is simply a measure of the degree to which an external stress is amplified at 
the tip of a crack. 

By way of comment, it should be said that stress amplification is not restricted 
to these microscopic defects; it may occur at macroscopic internal discontinuities 
(e.g., voids or inclusions), at sharp corners, scratches, and notches. 

Furthermore, the effect of a stress raiser is more significant in brittle than in 
ductile materials. For a ductile metal, plastic deformation ensues when the maxi¬ 
mum stress exceeds the yield strength. This leads to a more uniform distribution 
of stress in the vicinity of the stress raiser and to the development of a maximum 
stress concentration factor less than the theoretical value. Such yielding and stress 
redistribution do not occur to any appreciable extent around flaws and disconti¬ 
nuities in brittle materials; therefore, essentially the theoretical stress concentra¬ 
tion will result. 

Using principles of fracture mechanics, it is possible to show that the critical stress 
cr c required for crack propagation in a brittle material is described by the expression 


where 



(8.3) 


E = modulus of elasticity 

y s = specific surface energy 

a = one-half the length of an internal crack 

All brittle materials contain a population of small cracks and flaws that have a 
variety of sizes, geometries, and orientations. When the magnitude of a tensile stress 
at the tip of one of these flaws exceeds the value of this critical stress, a crack forms 
and then propagates, which results in fracture. Very small and virtually defect-free 
metallic and ceramic whiskers have been grown with fracture strengths that ap¬ 
proach their theoretical values.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 8.1 


Maximum Flaw Length Computation 

A relatively large plate of a glass is subjected to a tensile stress of 40 MPa. If 
the specific surface energy and modulus of elasticity for this glass are 0.3 J/m 2 
and 69 GPa, respectively, determine the maximum length of a surface flaw 
that is possible without fracture. 

Solution 

To solve this problem it is necessary to employ Equation 8.3. Rearrangement 
of this expression such that a is the dependent variable, and realizing that 
cr = 40 MPa, y s = 0.3 J/m 2 , and E = 69 GPa, leads to

Fracture Toughness 

Furthermore, using fracture mechanical principles, an expression has been developed 
that relates this critical stress for crack propagation ( cr c ) and crack length ( a ) as 

K c = Ya c V^a (8.4) 

In this expression K c is the fracture toughness, a property that is a measure of a 
material’s resistance to brittle fracture when a crack is present. Worth noting is that 
K c has the unusual units of MPaVm or psiVirn (alternatively, ksiVnu). Further¬ 
more, Y is a dimensionless parameter or function that depends on both crack and 
specimen sizes and geometries as well as the manner of load application. 

Relative to this Y parameter, for planar specimens containing cracks that are 
much shorter than the specimen width, Y has a value of approximately unity. For 
example, for a plate of infinite width having a through-thickness crack (Figure 8.9a),

Y = 1.0, whereas for a plate of semi-infinite width containing an edge crack of 
length a (Figure 8.9 b), Y = 1.1. Mathematical expressions for V have been deter¬ 
mined for a variety of crack-specimen geometries; these expressions are often rela¬ 
tively complex. 

For relatively thin specimens, the value of K c will depend on specimen thick¬ 
ness. However, when specimen thickness is much greater than the crack dimen¬ 
sions, K c becomes independent of thickness; under these conditions a condition 
of plane strain exists. By plane strain we mean that when a load operates on a 
crack in the manner represented in Figure 8.9a, there is no strain component 
perpendicular to the front and back faces. The K c value for this thick-specimen 
situation is known as the plane strain fracture toughness K Ic \ furthermore, it is 
also defined by 


K Ic = YaVmi (8.5) 

K Ic is the fracture toughness cited for most situations. The / (i.e., Roman numeral 
“one”) subscript for K Ic denotes that the plane strain fracture toughness is for mode 
I crack displacement, as illustrated in Figure 8.10a. 2 

Brittle materials, for which appreciable plastic deformation is not possible in 
front of an advancing crack, have low K Ic values and are vulnerable to catastrophic 
failure. On the other hand, K Ic values are relatively large for ductile materials. Frac¬ 
ture mechanics is especially useful in predicting catastrophic failure in materials 
having intermediate ductilities. Plane strain fracture toughness values for a number 
of different materials are presented in Table 8.1 (and Figure 1.6); a more extensive 
list of K Ic values is contained in Table B.5, Appendix B. 

The plane strain fracture toughness K Ic is a fundamental material property that 
depends on many factors, the most influential of which are temperature, strain rate, 
and microstructure. The magnitude of K Ic diminishes with increasing strain rate 
and decreasing temperature. Furthermore, an enhancement in yield strength 
wrought by solid solution or dispersion additions or by strain hardening generally 
produces a corresponding decrease in K Ic . Furthermore, K Ic normally increases with 
reduction in grain size as composition and other microstructural variables are main¬ 
tained constant. Yield strengths are included for some of the materials listed in 
Table 8.1. 


2 Two other crack displacement modes denoted by II and III and as illustrated in Figures 
8.10 b and 8.10c are also possible; however, mode I is most commonly encountered.

Several different testing techniques are used to measure K Ic ? Virtually any spec¬ 
imen size and shape consistent with mode I crack displacement may be utilized, 
and accurate values will be realized provided that the Y scale parameter in Equa¬ 
tion 8.5 has been properly determined. 

Design Using Fracture Mechanics 

According to Equations 8.4 and 8.5, three variables must be considered relative to 
the possibility for fracture of some structural component—namely, the fracture 
toughness ( K c ) or plane strain fracture toughness (K Ic ), the imposed stress (cr), and 
the flaw size (a) — assuming, of course, that Y has been determined. When design¬ 
ing a component, it is first important to decide which of these variables are con¬ 
strained by the application and which are subject to design control. For example, 
material selection (and hence K c or K Ic ) is often dictated by factors such as density 
(for lightweight applications) or the corrosion characteristics of the environment. 
Or, the allowable flaw size is either measured or specified by the limitations of avail¬ 
able flaw detection techniques. It is important to realize, however, that once any 
combination of two of the preceding parameters is prescribed, the third becomes 
fixed (Equations 8.4 and 8.5). For example, assume that K Ic and the magnitude of

A number of nondestructive test (NDT) techniques have been developed that 
permit detection and measurement of both internal and surface flaws. 4 Such tech¬ 
niques are used to examine structural components that are in service for defects 
and flaws that could lead to premature failure; in addition, NDTs are used as a 
means of quality control for manufacturing processes. As the name implies, these 
techniques must not destroy the material/structure being examined. Furthermore, 
some testing methods must be conducted in a laboratory setting; others may be 
adapted for use in the field. Several commonly employed NDT techniques and their 
characteristics are listed in Table 8.2. 

One important example of the use of NDT is for the detection of cracks and 
leaks in the walls of oil pipelines in remote areas such as Alaska. Ultrasonic analy¬ 
sis is utilized in conjunction with a “robotic analyzer” that can travel relatively long 
distances within a pipeline. 




DESIGN EXAMPLE 8.1 


Material Specification for a Pressurized Spherical Tank 


Consider the thin-walled spherical tank of radius r and thickness t (Figure 8.11) 
that may be used as a pressure vessel. 


4 Sometimes the terms nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and nondestructive inspection 
(NDI) are also used for these techniques.

Chapter 8 / Failure

Figure 8.11 Schematic 
diagram showing the 


cross section of a 
spherical tank that is 


subjected to an internal 
pressure p and that has 
a radial crack of length 
2 a in its wall. 


(a) One design of such a tank calls for yielding of the wall material prior to fail¬ 
ure as a result of the formation of a crack of critical size and its subsequent rapid 
propagation. Thus, plastic distortion of the wall may be observed and the pres¬ 
sure within the tank released before the occurrence of catastrophic failure. 
Consequently, materials having large critical crack lengths are desired. On the 
basis of this criterion, rank the metal alloys listed in Table B.5, Appendix B, as 
to critical crack size, from longest to shortest. 

(b) An alternative design that is also often utilized with pressure vessels is 
termed leak-before-break. Using principles of fracture mechanics, allowance is 
made for the growth of a crack through the thickness of the vessel wall prior to 
the occurrence of rapid crack propagation (Figure 8.11). Thus, the crack will com¬ 
pletely penetrate the wall without catastrophic failure, allowing for its detection 
by the leaking of pressurized fluid. With this criterion the critical crack length a c 
(i.e., one-half the total internal crack length) is taken to be equal to the pressure 
vessel thickness t. Allowance for a c = t instead of a c = t/2 ensures that fluid leak¬ 
age will occur prior to the buildup of dangerously high pressures. Using this 
criterion, rank the metal alloys in Table B.5, Appendix B as to the maximum 
allowable pressure. 

For this spherical pressure vessel, the circumferential wall stress a is a function 
of the pressure p in the vessel and the radius r and wall thickness t according to 


pr 


( 8 . 8 ) 


For both parts (a) and (b) assume a condition of plane strain. 

Solution 

(a) For the first design criterion, it is desired that the circumferential wall stress 
be less than the yield strength of the material. Substitution of a y for cr in Equa¬ 
tion 8.5 and incorporation of a factor of safety N leads to 



(8.9) 


where a c is the critical crack length. Solving for a c yields the following expression: 



( 8 . 10 )

Therefore, the critical crack length is proportional to the square of the K Ic -cr y 
ratio, which is the basis for the ranking of the metal alloys in Table B.5. The rank¬ 
ing is provided in Table 8.3, where it may be seen that the medium carbon (1040) 
steel with the largest ratio has the longest critical crack length, and, therefore, is 
the most desirable material on the basis of this criterion. 

(b) As stated previously, the leak-before-break criterion is just met when one- 
half of the internal crack length is equal to the thickness of the pressure vessel — 
that is, when a = t. Substitution of a = t into Equation 8.5 gives 

K Ic = YaV^t (8.11) 


and, from Equation 8.8, 



( 8 . 12 ) 


The stress is replaced by the yield strength, inasmuch as the tank should be designed 
to contain the pressure without yielding; furthermore, substitution of Equation 8.12 
into Equation 8.11, after some rearrangement, yields the following expression: 

2 

P =

(8.13) 


Hence, for some given spherical vessel of radius r, the maximum allowable pres¬ 
sure consistent with this leak-before-break criterion is proportional to K 2 Ic /o- y . 
The same several materials are ranked according to this ratio in Table 8.4; as may 
be noted, the medium carbon steel will contain the greatest pressures. 

Of the 11 metal alloys that are listed in Table B.5, the medium carbon steel 
ranks first according to both yielding and leak-before-break criteria. For these 
reasons, many pressure vessels are constructed of medium carbon steels, when 
temperature extremes and corrosion need not be considered.

8.6 FRACTURE TOUGHNESS TESTING 



A number of different standardized tests have been devised to measure the frac¬ 
ture toughness values for structural materials. 5 In the United States these standard 
test methods are developed by ASTM. Procedures and specimen configurations for 
most tests are relatively complicated, and we will not attempt to provide detailed 
explanations. In brief, for each test type, the specimen (of specified geometry and 
size) contains a preexisting defect, usually a sharp crack that has been introduced. 
The test apparatus loads the specimen at a specified rate, and also measures load 
and crack displacement values. Data are subjected to analyses to ensure that they 
meet established criteria before the fracture toughness values are deemed accept¬ 
able. Most tests are for metals, but some have also been developed for ceramics, 
polymers, and composites. 


Impact Testing Techniques 

Prior to the advent of fracture mechanics as a scientific discipline, impact testing 
techniques were established so as to ascertain the fracture characteristics of mate¬ 
rials at high loading rates. It was realized that the results of laboratory tensile tests 
(at low loading rates) could not be extrapolated to predict fracture behavior. For 
example, under some circumstances normally ductile metals fracture abruptly and 
with very little plastic deformation under high loading rates. Impact test conditions 
were chosen to represent those most severe relative to the potential for fracture — 


5 For example: ASTM Standard E 561-05E1, “Standard Test Method for K-R Curve Deter¬ 
mination”; ASTM Standard E 1290-08, “Standard Test Method for Crack-Tip Opening 
Displacement (CTOD) Fracture Toughness Measurement”; and ASTM Standard E 1820-08, 
“Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness.”

namely, (1) deformation at a relatively low temperature, (2) a high strain rate (i.e., 
rate of deformation), and (3) a triaxial stress state (which may be introduced by the 
presence of a notch). 

Two standardized tests, 6 the Charpy and Izod, were designed and are still used 
to measure the impact energy (sometimes also termed notch toughness). The 
Charpy V-notch (CVN) technique is most commonly used in the United States. 
For both Charpy and Izod, the specimen is in the shape of a bar of square cross 
section, into which a V-notch is machined (Figure 8.12a). The apparatus for mak¬ 
ing V-notch impact tests is illustrated schematically in Figure 8.12 b. The load is ap¬ 
plied as an impact blow from a weighted pendulum hammer that is released from 
a cocked position at a fixed height h. The specimen is positioned at the base as 
shown. Upon release, a knife edge mounted on the pendulum strikes and fractures 
the specimen at the notch, which acts as a point of stress concentration for this 
high-velocity impact blow. The pendulum continues its swing, rising to a maximum 
height h', which is lower than h. The energy absorption, computed from the 
difference between h and h', is a measure of the impact energy. The primary dif¬ 
ference between the Charpy and Izod techniques lies in the manner of specimen 
support, as illustrated in Figure 8.12 b. Furthermore, these are termed impact tests 
in light of the manner of load application. Variables including specimen size and 
shape as well as notch configuration and depth influence the test results. 

Both plane strain fracture toughness and these impact tests have been used to 
determine the fracture properties of materials. The former are quantitative in na¬ 
ture, in that a specific property of the material is determined (i.e., K Ic ). The results 
of the impact tests, on the other hand, are more qualitative and are of little use for 
design purposes. Impact energies are of interest mainly in a relative sense and for 
making comparisons —absolute values are of little significance. Attempts have been 
made to correlate plane strain fracture toughnesses and CVN energies, with only 
limited success. Plane strain fracture toughness tests are not as simple to perform 
as impact tests; furthermore, equipment and specimens are more expensive. 

Ductile-to-Brittle Transition 

One of the primary functions of Charpy and Izod tests is to determine whether a 
material experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition with decreasing temperature and, 
if so, the range of temperatures over which it occurs. As may be noted in the chapter¬ 
opening photograph of the fractured oil tanker for this chapter, widely used steels can 
exhibit this ductile-to-brittle transition with disastrous consequences. The ductile- 
to-brittle transition is related to the temperature dependence of the measured 
impact energy absorption. This transition is represented for a steel by curve A in 
Figure 8.13. At higher temperatures the CVN energy is relatively large, in correla¬ 
tion with a ductile mode of fracture. As the temperature is lowered, the impact en¬ 
ergy drops suddenly over a relatively narrow temperature range, below which the 
energy has a constant but small value; that is, the mode of fracture is brittle. 

Alternatively, appearance of the failure surface is indicative of the nature of frac¬ 
ture and may be used in transition temperature determinations. For ductile fracture 
this surface appears fibrous or dull (or of shear character), as in the steel specimen 
of Figure 8.14 that was tested at 79°C. Conversely, totally brittle surfaces have a gran¬ 
ular (shiny) texture (or cleavage character) (the -59°C specimen, Figure 8.14).

Materials.”

Over the ductile-to-brittle transition, features of both types will exist (in Figure 8.14, 
displayed by specimens tested at -12°C, 4°C, 16°C, and 24°C). Frequently, the per¬ 
cent shear fracture is plotted as a function of temperature-curve B in Figure 8.13. 

For many alloys there is a range of temperatures over which the ductile-to-brittle 
transition occurs (Figure 8.13); this presents some difficulty in specifying a single 
ductile-to-brittle transition temperature. No explicit criterion has been established, 
and so this temperature is often defined as that temperature at which the CVN 
energy assumes some value (e.g., 20 J or 15 ft-lb f ), or corresponding to some given

fracture appearance (e.g., 50% fibrous fracture). Matters are further complicated 
inasmuch as a different transition temperature may be realized for each of these cri¬ 
teria. Perhaps the most conservative transition temperature is that at which the frac¬ 
ture surface becomes 100% fibrous; on this basis, the transition temperature is 
approximately 110°C (230°F) for the steel alloy that is the subject of Figure 8.13. 

Structures constructed from alloys that exhibit this ductile-to-brittle behavior 
should be used only at temperatures above the transition temperature, to avoid brit¬ 
tle and catastrophic failure. Classic examples of this type of failure occurred, with 
disastrous consequences, during World War II when a number of welded transport 
ships, away from combat, suddenly and precipitously split in half. The vessels were 
constructed of a steel alloy that possessed adequate toughness according to room- 
temperature tensile tests. The brittle fractures occurred at relatively low ambient 
temperatures, at about 4°C (40°F), in the vicinity of the transition temperature 
of the alloy. Each fracture crack originated at some point of stress concentration, 
probably a sharp corner or fabrication defect, and then propagated around the entire 
girth of the ship.

Figure 8.15 Schematic curves for 
the three general types of impact 
energy-versus-temperature 
behavior. 


In addition to the ductile-to-brittle transition represented in Figure 8.13, two 
other general types of impact energy-versus-temperature behavior have been 
observed; these are represented schematically by the upper and lower curves of 
Figure 8.15. Here it may be noted that low-strength FCC metals (some aluminum 
and copper alloys) and most HCP metals do not experience a ductile-to-brittle tran¬ 
sition (corresponding to the upper curve of Figure 8.15), and retain high impact energies 
(i.e., remain tough) with decreasing temperature. For high-strength materials (e.g., 
high-strength steels and titanium alloys), the impact energy is also relatively insen¬ 
sitive to temperature (the lower curve of Figure 8.15); however, these materials are 
also very brittle, as reflected by their low impact energy values. And, of course, the 
characteristic ductile-to-brittle transition is represented by the middle curve of Fig¬ 
ure 8.15. As noted, this behavior is typically found in low-strength steels that have 
the BCC crystal structure. 

For these low-strength steels, the transition temperature is sensitive to both 
alloy composition and microstructure. For example, decreasing the average grain 
size results in a lowering of the transition temperature. Hence, refining the grain 
size both strengthens (Section 7.8) and toughens steels. In contrast, increasing the 
carbon content, while increasing the strength of steels, also raises the CVN transition 
of steels, as indicated in Figure 8.16.

8.7 Cyclic Stresses * 255 


Most ceramics and polymers also experience a ductile-to-brittle transition. For 
ceramic materials, the transition occurs only at elevated temperatures, ordinarily in 
excess of 1000°C (1850°F). This behavior as related to polymers is discussed in 
Section 15.6. 


Fatigue 

fatigue Fatigue is a form of failure that occurs in structures subjected to dynamic and fluctu¬ 

ating stresses (e.g., bridges, aircraft, and machine components). Under these circum¬ 
stances it is possible for failure to occur at a stress level considerably lower than the 
tensile or yield strength for a static load. The term fatigue is used because this type of 
failure normally occurs after a lengthy period of repeated stress or strain cycling. Fa¬ 
tigue is important inasmuch as it is the single largest cause of failure in metals, esti¬ 
mated to comprise approximately 90% of all metallic failures; polymers and ceramics 
(except for glasses) are also susceptible to this type of failure. Furthermore, fatigue is 
catastrophic and insidious, occurring very suddenly and without warning. 

Fatigue failure is brittlelike in nature even in normally ductile metals, in that 
there is very little, if any, gross plastic deformation associated with failure. The 
process occurs by the initiation and propagation of cracks, and ordinarily the frac¬ 
ture surface is perpendicular to the direction of an applied tensile stress.

The applied stress may be axial (tension-compression), flexural (bending), or torsional 
(twisting) in nature. In general, three different fluctuating stress-time modes are pos¬ 
sible. One is represented schematically by a regular and sinusoidal time dependence 
in Figure 8.17a, wherein the amplitude is symmetrical about a mean zero stress level, 
for example, alternating from a maximum tensile stress (<x max ) to a minimum com¬ 
pressive stress (<x min ) of equal magnitude; this is referred to as a reversed stress cycle. 
Another type, termed repeated stress cycle , is illustrated in Figure 8.175; the maxima 
and minima are asymmetrical relative to the zero stress level. Finally, the stress level 
may vary randomly in amplitude and frequency, as exemplified in Figure 8.17c. 

Also indicated in Figure 8.175 are several parameters used to characterize the 
fluctuating stress cycle. The stress amplitude alternates about a mean stress <x m , de¬ 
fined as the average of the maximum and minimum stresses in the cycle, or

°m = -2- ( 8 * 14 ) 

Furthermore, the range of stress cr r is j ust the difference between <x max and cr min —namely,

8.8 The S-N Curve • 257 


8.8 THE S-N CURVE 

As with other mechanical characteristics, the fatigue properties of materials can be 
determined from laboratory simulation tests. 7 A test apparatus should be designed 
to duplicate as nearly as possible the service stress conditions (stress level, time fre¬ 
quency, stress pattern, etc.). A schematic diagram of a rotating-bending test appa¬ 
ratus, commonly used for fatigue testing, is shown in Figure 8.18; the compression 
and tensile stresses are imposed on the specimen as it is simultaneously bent and 
rotated. Tests are also frequently conducted using an alternating uniaxial tension- 
compression stress cycle. 

A series of tests are commenced by subjecting a specimen to the stress cy¬ 
cling at a relatively large maximum stress amplitude (<x ma x)> usually on the order 
of two-thirds of the static tensile strength; the number of cycles to failure is 
counted. This procedure is repeated on other specimens at progressively 
decreasing maximum stress amplitudes. Data are plotted as stress S versus the 
logarithm of the number N of cycles to failure for each of the specimens. The val¬ 
ues of S are normally taken as stress amplitudes ( cr a , Equation 8.16); on occasion, 
(7 ma x or <x min values may be used. 

Two distinct types of S-N behavior are observed, which are represented 
schematically in Figure 8.19. As these plots indicate, the higher the magnitude of 
the stress, the smaller the number of cycles the material is capable of sustaining be¬ 
fore failure. For some ferrous (iron base) and titanium alloys, the S-N curve (Fig¬ 
ure 8.19a) becomes horizontal at higher N values; or there is a limiting stress level, 
fatigue limit called the fatigue limit (also sometimes the endurance limit), below which fatigue 

failure will not occur. This fatigue limit represents the largest value of fluctuating 
stress that will not cause failure for essentially an infinite number of cycles. For 
many steels, fatigue limits range between 35% and 60% of the tensile strength. 

Most nonferrous alloys (e.g., aluminum, copper, magnesium) do not have a 
fatigue limit, in that the S-N curve continues its downward trend at increasingly 
greater A values (Figure 8.19Z?).Thus, fatigue will ultimately occur regardless of the 
magnitude of the stress. For these materials, the fatigue response is specified as 
fatigue strength fatigue strength, which is defined as the stress level at which failure will occur for 

some specified number of cycles (e.g., 10 7 cycles). The determination of fatigue 
strength is also demonstrated in Figure 8.19A

Another important parameter that characterizes a material’s fatigue behavior 
is fatigue life N f . It is the number of cycles to cause failure at a specified stress level, 
as taken from the S-N plot (Figure 8.19 b). 

Unfortunately, there always exists considerable scatter in fatigue data—that is, 
a variation in the measured N value for a number of specimens tested at the same 
stress level. This variation may lead to significant design uncertainties when fatigue 
life and/or fatigue limit (or strength) are being considered. The scatter in results is 
a consequence of the fatigue sensitivity to a number of test and material parame¬ 
ters that are impossible to control precisely. These parameters include specimen 
fabrication and surface preparation, metallurgical variables, specimen alignment in 
the apparatus, mean stress, and test frequency. 

Fatigue S-N curves similar to those shown in Figure 8.19 represent “best fit” 
curves that have been drawn through average-value data points. It is a little unset¬ 
tling to realize that approximately one-half of the specimens tested actually failed 
at stress levels lying nearly 25% below the curve (as determined on the basis of 
statistical treatments).

Cycles to failure, N 
(logarithmic scale) 


Several statistical techniques have been developed to specify fatigue life and 
fatigue limit in terms of probabilities. One convenient way of representing data 
treated in this manner is with a series of constant probability curves, several of which 
are plotted in Figure 8.20. The P value associated with each curve represents the 
probability of failure. For example, at a stress of 200 MPa (30,000 psi), we would 
expect 1% of the specimens to fail at about 10 6 cycles and 50% to fail at about 
2 X 10 7 cycles, and so on. Remember that S-N curves represented in the literature 
are normally average values, unless noted otherwise. 

The fatigue behaviors represented in Figures 8.19a and 8.19 b may be clas¬ 
sified into two domains. One is associated with relatively high loads that produce 
not only elastic strain but also some plastic strain during each cycle. Conse¬ 
quently, fatigue lives are relatively short; this domain is termed low-cycle fatigue 
and occurs at less than about 10 4 to 10 5 cycles. For lower stress levels wherein 
deformations are totally elastic, longer lives result. This is called high-cycle fatigue 
inasmuch as relatively large numbers of cycles are required to produce fatigue fail¬ 
ure. High-cycle fatigue is associated with fatigue lives greater than about 10 4 to 
10 5 cycles. 


8.9 CRACK INITIATION AND PROPAGATION 

The process of fatigue failure is characterized by three distinct steps: (1) crack ini¬ 
tiation, wherein a small crack forms at some point of high stress concentration; (2) 
crack propagation, during which this crack advances incrementally with each stress 
cycle; and (3) final failure, which occurs very rapidly once the advancing crack has 
reached a critical size. Cracks associated with fatigue failure almost always initiate 
(or nucleate) on the surface of a component at some point of stress concentration. 
Crack nucleation sites include surface scratches, sharp fillets, keyways, threads, dents, 
and the like. In addition, cyclic loading can produce microscopic surface disconti¬ 
nuities resulting from dislocation slip steps that may also act as stress raisers, and 
therefore as crack initiation sites. 

The region of a fracture surface that formed during the crack propagation step 
may be characterized by two types of markings termed beachmarks and striations. 
Both of these features indicate the position of the crack tip at some point in time 
and appear as concentric ridges that expand away from the crack initiation site(s), 
frequently in a circular or semicircular pattern. Beachmarks (sometimes also called

“clamshell marks”) are of macroscopic dimensions (Figure 8.21), and may be 
observed with the unaided eye. These markings are found for components that ex¬ 
perienced interruptions during the crack propagation stage—for example, a ma¬ 
chine that operated only during normal work-shift hours. Each beachmark band 
represents a period of time over which crack growth occurred. 

On the other hand, fatigue striations are microscopic in size and subject to ob¬ 
servation with the electron microscope (either TEM or SEM). Figure 8.22 is an elec¬ 
tron fractograph that shows this feature. Each striation is thought to represent the

advance distance of a crack front during a single load cycle. Striation width depends 
on, and increases with, increasing stress range. 

At this point it should be emphasized that although both beachmarks and stri- 
ations are fatigue fracture surface features having similar appearances, they are 
nevertheless different, both in origin and size. There may be thousands of striations 
within a single beachmark. 

Often the cause of failure may be deduced after examination of the failure sur¬ 
faces. The presence of beachmarks and/or striations on a fracture surface confirms 
that the cause of failure was fatigue. Nevertheless, the absence of either or both 
does not exclude fatigue as the cause of failure. 

One final comment regarding fatigue failure surfaces: Beachmarks and stria¬ 
tions will not appear on that region over which the rapid failure occurs. Rather, the 
rapid failure may be either ductile or brittle; evidence of plastic deformation will 
be present for ductile, and absent for brittle, failure. This region of failure may be 
noted in Figure 8.23.

8.10 FACTORS THAT AFFECT FATIGUE LIFE 

As mentioned in Section 8.8, the fatigue behavior of engineering materials is highly 
sensitive to a number of variables. Some of these factors include mean stress level, 
geometrical design, surface effects, and metallurgical variables, as well as the envi¬ 
ronment. This section is devoted to a discussion of these factors and, in addition, to 
measures that may be taken to improve the fatigue resistance of structural 
components. 

Mean Stress 

The dependence of fatigue life on stress amplitude is represented on the S-N plot. 
Such data are taken for a constant mean stress <x m , often for the reversed cycle sit¬ 
uation (<x m = 0). Mean stress, however, will also affect fatigue life; this influence 
may be represented by a series of S-N curves, each measured at a different <x m , as 
depicted schematically in Figure 8.24. As may be noted, increasing the mean stress 
level leads to a decrease in fatigue life. 

Surface Effects 

For many common loading situations, the maximum stress within a component or 
structure occurs at its surface. Consequently, most cracks leading to fatigue failure 
originate at surface positions, specifically at stress amplification sites. Therefore, it 
has been observed that fatigue life is especially sensitive to the condition and con¬ 
figuration of the component surface. Numerous factors influence fatigue resistance, 
the proper management of which will lead to an improvement in fatigue life. These 
include design criteria as well as various surface treatments. 

Design Factors 

The design of a component can have a significant influence on its fatigue charac¬ 
teristics. Any notch or geometrical discontinuity can act as a stress raiser and fatigue 
crack initiation site; these design features include grooves, holes, keyways, threads, 
and so on. The sharper the discontinuity (i.e., the smaller the radius of curvature), 
the more severe the stress concentration. The probability of fatigue failure may be 
reduced by avoiding (when possible) these structural irregularities, or by making de¬ 
sign modifications whereby sudden contour changes leading to sharp corners are 
eliminated—for example, calling for rounded fillets with large radii of curvature at 
the point where there is a change in diameter for a rotating shaft (Figure 8.25).

influence of mean stress a m on S-N 
fatigue behavior.

Surface Treatments 

During machining operations, small scratches and grooves are invariably introduced 
into the workpiece surface by cutting tool action. These surface markings can limit 
the fatigue life. It has been observed that improving the surface finish by polishing 
will enhance fatigue life significantly. 

One of the most effective methods of increasing fatigue performance is by 
imposing residual compressive stresses within a thin outer surface layer. Thus, a 
surface tensile stress of external origin will be partially nullified and reduced in 
magnitude by the residual compressive stress. The net effect is that the likelihood 
of crack formation and therefore of fatigue failure is reduced. 

Residual compressive stresses are commonly introduced into ductile metals me¬ 
chanically by localized plastic deformation within the outer surface region. Com¬ 
mercially, this is often accomplished by a process termed shot peening. Small, hard 
particles (shot) having diameters within the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mm are projected 
at high velocities onto the surface to be treated. The resulting deformation induces 
compressive stresses to a depth of between one-quarter and one-half of the shot 
diameter. The influence of shot peening on the fatigue behavior of steel is demon¬ 
strated schematically in Figure 8.26. 

Case hardening is a technique by which both surface hardness and fatigue life 
are enhanced for steel alloys. This is accomplished by a carburizing or nitriding 
process whereby a component is exposed to a carbonaceous or nitrogenous atmos¬ 
phere at an elevated temperature. A carbon- or nitrogen-rich outer surface layer (or 
“case”) is introduced by atomic diffusion from the gaseous phase. The case is nor¬ 
mally on the order of 1 mm deep and is harder than the inner core of material. (The 
influence of carbon content on hardness for Fe-C alloys is demonstrated in Fig¬ 
ure 10.29a.) The improvement of fatigue properties results from increased hardness

observed for the gear shown in the top chapter-opening photograph for Chapter 5; 
it appears as a dark outer rim within the sectioned segment. The increase in case 
hardness is demonstrated in the photomicrograph appearing in Figure 8.27. The dark

indentation, lying within the carburized layer, is smaller than the core indentation.

corrosion fatigue 


Environmental factors may also affect the fatigue behavior of materials. A few brief 
comments will be given relative to two types of environment-assisted fatigue fail¬ 
ure: thermal fatigue and corrosion fatigue. 

Thermal fatigue is normally induced at elevated temperatures by fluctuating 
thermal stresses; mechanical stresses from an external source need not be present. 
The origin of these thermal stresses is the restraint to the dimensional expansion 
and/or contraction that would normally occur in a structural member with variations 
in temperature. The magnitude of a thermal stress developed by a temperature 
change AT is dependent on the coefficient of thermal expansion a x and the modulus 
of elasticity E according to 


cr = a t EAT (8.18) 

(The topics of thermal expansion and thermal stresses are discussed in Sections 19.3 
and 19.5.) Of course, thermal stresses will not arise if this mechanical restraint is ab¬ 
sent. Therefore, one obvious way to prevent this type of fatigue is to eliminate, or at 
least reduce, the restraint source, thus allowing unhindered dimensional changes with 
temperature variations, or to choose materials with appropriate physical properties. 

Failure that occurs by the simultaneous action of a cyclic stress and chemical 
attack is termed corrosion fatigue. Corrosive environments have a deleterious in¬ 
fluence and produce shorter fatigue lives. Even the normal ambient atmosphere will 
affect the fatigue behavior of some materials. Small pits may form as a result of 
chemical reactions between the environment and material, which serve as points of 
stress concentration and therefore as crack nucleation sites. In addition, crack 
propagation rate is enhanced as a result of the corrosive environment. The nature 







8.12 Generalized Creep Behavior * 265 

of the stress cycles will influence the fatigue behavior; for example, lowering the 
load application frequency leads to longer periods during which the opened crack 
is in contact with the environment and to a reduction in the fatigue life. 

Several approaches to corrosion fatigue prevention exist. On one hand, we can 
take measures to reduce the rate of corrosion by some of the techniques discussed 
in Chapter 17—for example, apply protective surface coatings, select a more corrosion- 
resistant material, and reduce the corrosiveness of the environment. And/or it might 
be advisable to take actions to minimize the probability of normal fatigue failure, 
as outlined previously—for example, reduce the applied tensile stress level and 
impose residual compressive stresses on the surface of the member. 


Creep 


Materials are often placed in service at elevated temperatures and exposed to static 
mechanical stresses (e.g., turbine rotors in jet engines and steam generators that ex¬ 
perience centrifugal stresses, and high-pressure steam lines). Deformation under 

creep such circumstances is termed creep. Defined as the time-dependent and permanent 

deformation of materials when subjected to a constant load or stress, creep is nor¬ 
mally an undesirable phenomenon and is often the limiting factor in the lifetime of 
a part. It is observed in all materials types; for metals it becomes important only 
for temperatures greater than about 0AT m (T m = absolute melting temperature). 
Amorphous polymers, which include plastics and rubbers, are especially sensitive 
to creep deformation as discussed in Section 15.4. 

8.12 GENERALIZED CREEP BEHAVIOR 

A typical creep test 8 consists of subjecting a specimen to a constant load or stress 
while maintaining the temperature constant; deformation or strain is measured and 
plotted as a function of elapsed time. Most tests are the constant-load type, which 
yield information of an engineering nature; constant-stress tests are employed to 
provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of creep. 

Figure 8.28 is a schematic representation of the typical constant-load creep 
behavior of metals. Upon application of the load there is an instantaneous defor¬ 
mation, as indicated in the figure, which is totally elastic. The resulting creep curve 
consists of three regions, each of which has its own distinctive strain-time feature. 
Primary or transient creep occurs first, typified by a continuously decreasing creep 
rate; that is, the slope of the curve diminishes with time. This suggests that the ma¬ 
terial is experiencing an increase in creep resistance or strain hardening (Section 
7.10) —deformation becomes more difficult as the material is strained. For second¬ 
ary creep, sometimes termed steady-state creep, the rate is constant; that is, the plot 
becomes linear. This is often the stage of creep that is of the longest duration. The 
constancy of creep rate is explained on the basis of a balance between the com¬ 
peting processes of strain hardening and recovery, recovery (Section 7.11) being the 
process whereby a material becomes softer and retains its ability to experience 
deformation. Finally, for tertiary creep, there is an acceleration of the rate and 
ultimate failure. This failure is frequently termed rupture and results from 
microstructural and/or metallurgical changes; for example, grain boundary separa¬ 
tion, and the formation of internal cracks, cavities, and voids. Also, for tensile loads, 
a neck may form at some point within the deformation region. These all lead to a 
decrease in the effective cross-sectional area and an increase in strain rate.

Stress-Rupture Tests of Metallic Materials.”

load and constant elevated 
temperature. The minimum creep 
rate Ae/A t is the slope of the 
linear segment in the secondary 
region. Rupture lifetime t r is the 
total time to rupture. 


For metallic materials, most creep tests are conducted in uniaxial tension using 
a specimen having the same geometry as for tensile tests (Figure 6.2). On the other 
hand, uniaxial compression tests are more appropriate for brittle materials; these 
provide a better measure of the intrinsic creep properties inasmuch as there is no 
stress amplification and crack propagation, as with tensile loads. Compressive test 
specimens are usually right cylinders or parallelepipeds having length-to-diameter 
ratios ranging from about 2 to 4. For most materials, creep properties are virtually 
independent of loading direction. 

Possibly the most important parameter from a creep test is the slope of the 
secondary portion of the creep curve (Ae/A t in Figure 8.28); this is often called the 
minimum or steady-state creep rate e s . It is the engineering design parameter that is 
considered for long-life applications, such as a nuclear power plant component that 
is scheduled to operate for several decades, and when failure or too much strain 
are not options. On the other hand, for many relatively short-life creep situations 
(e.g., turbine blades in military aircraft and rocket motor nozzles), time to rupture , 
or the rupture lifetime t n is the dominant design consideration; it is also indicated 
in Figure 8.28. Of course, for its determination, creep tests must be conducted to 
the point of failure; these are termed creep rupture tests. Thus, a knowledge of these 
creep characteristics of a material allows the design engineer to ascertain its suit¬ 
ability for a specific application.

8.13 STRESS AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS 

Both temperature and the level of the applied stress influence the creep charac¬ 
teristics (Figure 8.29). At a temperature substantially below 0.4 T m , and after the initial 
deformation, the strain is virtually independent of time. With either increasing stress

or temperature, the following will be noted: (1) the instantaneous strain at the time 
of stress application increases, (2) the steady-state creep rate is increased, and 
(3) the rupture lifetime is diminished. 

The results of creep rupture tests are most commonly presented as the loga¬ 
rithm of stress versus the logarithm of rupture lifetime. Figure 8.30 is one such plot 
for an S-590 alloy in which a set of linear relationships can be seen to exist at each 
temperature. For some alloys and over relatively large stress ranges, nonlinearity in 
these curves is observed. 

Empirical relationships have been developed in which the steady-state creep 
rate as a function of stress and temperature is expressed. Its dependence on stress 
can be written

Each leads to a different value of the stress exponent n in Equation 8.19. It has 
been possible to elucidate the creep mechanism for a particular material by com¬ 
paring its experimental n value with values predicted for the various mechanisms. 
In addition, correlations have been made between the activation energy for creep 
( Q c ) and the activation energy for diffusion ( Q d , Equation 5.8). 

Creep data of this nature are represented pictorially for some well-studied sys¬ 
tems in the form of stress-temperature diagrams, which are termed deformation 
mechanism maps. These maps indicate stress-temperature regimes (or areas) over 
which various mechanisms operate. Constant strain rate contours are often also 
included. Thus, for some creep situation, given the appropriate deformation mech¬ 
anism map and any two of the three parameters—temperature, stress level, and 
creep strain rate —the third parameter may be determined. 


8.14 DATA EXTRAPOLATION METHODS 


The Larson-Miller 
parameter—in terms 
of temperature and 
rupture lifetime 


The need often arises for engineering creep data that are impractical to collect from 
normal laboratory tests. This is especially true for prolonged exposures (on the or¬ 
der of years). One solution to this problem involves performing creep and/or creep 
rupture tests at temperatures in excess of those required, for shorter time periods, 
and at a comparable stress level, and then making a suitable extrapolation to the 
in-service condition. A commonly used extrapolation procedure employs the 
Larson-Miller parameter, defined as 

T(C + log tf) (8.21) 

where C is a constant (usually on the order of 20), for T in Kelvin and the rupture 
lifetime t r in hours. The rupture lifetime of a given material measured at some

specific stress level will vary with temperature such that this parameter remains 
constant. Or, the data may be plotted as the logarithm of stress versus the Lar- 
son-Miller parameter, as shown in Figure 8.32. Utilization of this technique is 
demonstrated in the following design example.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 8.2 


Rupture Lifetime Prediction 


Using the Larson-Miller data for the S-590 alloy shown in Figure 8.32, predict 
the time to rupture for a component that is subjected to a stress of 140 MPa 
(20,000 psi) at 800°C (1073 K). 


Solution 

From Figure 8.32, at 140 MPa (20,000 psi) the value of the Larson-Miller 
parameter is 24.0 X 10 3 , for T in K and t r in h; therefore, 

24.0 X 10 3 = T (20 + log t r ) 

= 1073(20 + log t r ) 

and, solving for the time, 


22.37 = 20 + log t r 
t r = 233 h (9.7 days) 


8.15 ALLOYS FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE USE 



Several factors affect the creep characteristics of metals. These include melting 
temperature, elastic modulus, and grain size. In general, the higher the melting 
temperature, the greater the elastic modulus, and the larger the grain size, the

better a material’s resistance to creep. Relative to grain size, smaller grains per¬ 
mit more grain boundary sliding, which results in higher creep rates. This effect 
may be contrasted to the influence of grain size on the mechanical behavior at 
low temperatures [i.e., increase in both strength (Section 7.8) and toughness 
(Section 8.6)]. 

Stainless steels (Section 11.2) and the superalloys (Section 11.3) are especially 
resilient to creep and are commonly employed in high-temperature service appli¬ 
cations. The creep resistance of the superalloys is enhanced by solid-solution 
alloying and also by the formation of precipitate phases. In addition, advanced pro¬ 
cessing techniques have been utilized; one such technique is directional solidifica¬ 
tion, which produces either highly elongated grains or single-crystal components 
(Figure 8.33). 


SUMMARY 


Introduction 

• The three usual causes of failure are 

Improper materials selection and processing 
Inadequate component design 
Component misuse 

Fundamentals of Fracture 

• Fracture, in response to tensile loading and at relatively low temperatures, may 
occur by ductile and brittle modes. 

• Ductile fracture is normally preferred because 

Preventive measures may be taken inasmuch as evidence of plastic defor¬ 
mation indicate that fracture is imminent, and 
More energy is required to induce ductile fracture than for brittle fracture. 

• Cracks in ductile materials are said to be stable (i.e., resist extension without an 
increase in applied stress). 

• For brittle materials, cracks are unstable—that is, crack propagation, once started, 
will continue spontaneously without an increase in stress level. 



Summary * 271 


Ductile Fracture 

• For ductile metals, two tensile fracture profiles are possible: 

Necking down to a point fracture when ductility is high (Figure 8.1a), and 
Only moderate necking with a cup-and-cone fracture profile (Figure 8.1 b), 
when the material is less ductile. 

Brittle Fracture 

• For brittle fracture, the fracture surface is relatively flat and perpendicular to the 
direction of the applied tensile load (Figure 8.1c). 

• Transgranular (through-grain) and intergranular (between-grain) crack propaga¬ 
tion paths are possible for polycrystalline brittle materials. 

Principles of Fracture Mechanics 

• The significant discrepancy between actual and theoretical fracture strengths of 
brittle materials is explained by the existence of small flaws that are capable of 
amplifying an applied tensile stress in their vicinity, leading ultimately to crack 
formation. Fracture ensues when the theoretical cohesive strength is exceeded at 
the tip of one of these flaws. 

• The maximum stress that may exist at the tip of a crack (oriented as in Figure 
8.8a) is dependent on crack length and tip radius, as well as the applied tensile 
stress according to Equation 8.1. 

• Sharp corners may also act as points of stress concentration and should be avoided 
when designing structures that are subjected to stresses. 

• There are three different crack displacement modes (Figure 8.10): opening (ten¬ 
sile), sliding, and tearing. 

• A condition of plane strain is found when specimen thickness is much greater 
than crack length—that is, there is no strain component perpendicular to the spec¬ 
imen faces. 

• The fracture toughness of a material is indicative of its resistance to brittle frac¬ 
ture when a crack is present. For the plane strain situation (and mode I loading) 
it is dependent on applied stress, crack length, and the dimensionless scale pa¬ 
rameter Y as represented in Equation 8.5. 

• K Ic is the parameter normally cited for design purposes; its value is relatively 
large for ductile materials (and small for brittle ones) and is a function of 
microstructure, strain rate, and temperature. 

• With regard to designing against the possibility of fracture, consideration must 
be given to material (its fracture toughness), the stress level, and the flaw size de¬ 
tection limit. 

Fracture Toughness Testing 

• Three factors that may cause a metal to experience a ductile-to-brittle transition 
are exposure to stresses at relatively low temperatures, high strain rates, and the 
presence of a sharp notch. 

• Qualitatively, the fracture behavior of materials may be determined using Charpy 
and Izod impact testing techniques (Figure 8.12). 

• On the basis of the temperature dependence of measured impact energy (or ap¬ 
pearance of the fracture surface), it is possible to ascertain whether a material 
experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition and the temperature range over which 
such a transition occurs. 


272 * Chapter 8 / Failure 

• Low-strength steel alloys typify this ductile-to-brittle behavior and, for structural 
applications, should be used at temperatures in excess of the transition range. 
Furthermore, low-strength FCC metals, most HCP metals, and high-strength ma¬ 
terials do not experience this ductile-to-brittle transition. 

• For low-strength steel alloys, the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature may be 
lowered by decreasing grain size and lowering the carbon content. 

Fatigue 

• Fatigue is a common type of catastrophic failure wherein the applied stress level 
fluctuates with time; it occurs when the maximum stress level may be consider¬ 
ably lower than the static tensile or yield strength. 

Cyclic Stresses 

• Fluctuating stresses are categorized into three general stress-versus-time cycle 
modes: reversed, repeated, and random (Figure 8.17). Reversed and repeated are 
characterized in terms of mean stress, range of stress, and stress amplitude. 

The S-N Curve 

• Test data are plotted as stress (normally stress amplitude) versus the logarithm 
of the number of cycles to failure. 

• For many metals and alloys, stress diminishes continuously with increasing num¬ 
ber of cycles at failure; fatigue strength and fatigue life are parameters used to 
characterize the fatigue behavior of these materials (Figure 8.1%). 

• For other metals (e.g., ferrous and titanium alloys), at some point, stress ceases 
to decrease with, and becomes independent of, the number of cycles; the fatigue 
behavior of these materials is expressed in terms of fatigue limit (Figure 8.19a). 

Crack Initiation and Propagation 

• Fatigue cracks normally nucleate on the surface of a component at some point 
of stress concentration. 

• Two characteristic fatigue surface features are beachmarks and striations. 

Beachmarks form on components that experience applied stress interrup¬ 
tions; they normally may be observed with the naked eye. 

Fatigue striations are of microscopic dimensions, and each is thought to rep¬ 
resent the crack tip advance distance over a single load cycle. 

Factors That Affect Fatigue Life 

• Measures that may be taken to extend fatigue life include the following: 

Reducing the mean stress level 

Eliminating sharp surface discontinuities 

Improving the surface finish by polishing 

Imposing surface residual compressive stresses by shot peening 

Case hardening by using a carburizing or nitriding process 

Environmental Effects 

• Thermal stresses may be induced in components that are exposed to elevated 
temperature fluctuations and when thermal expansion and/or contraction is re¬ 
strained; fatigue for these conditions is termed thermal fatigue. 


Summary • 273 


• The presence of a chemically active environment may lead to a reduction in 
fatigue life for corrosion fatigue. Measures that may be taken to prevent this type 
of fatigue include the following: 

Application of a surface coating 
Utilization of a more corrosion-resistant material 
Reducing the corrosiveness of the environment 
Reducing the applied tensile stress level 

Imposing residual compressive stresses on the surface of the specimen 

Generalized Creep Behavior 

• The time-dependent plastic deformation of metals subjected to a constant load 
(or stress) and at temperatures greater than about 0.4 T m is termed creep. 

• A typical creep curve (strain versus time) will normally exhibit three distinct regions 
(Figure 8.28): transient (or primary), steady-state (or secondary), and tertiary. 

• Important design parameters available from such a plot include the steady-state 
creep rate (slope of the linear region) and rupture lifetime (Figure 8.28). 

Stress and Temperature Effects 

• Both temperature and applied stress level influence creep behavior. Increasing 
either of these parameters produces the following effects: 

An increase in the instantaneous initial deformation 
An increase in the steady-state creep rate 
A diminishment of the rupture lifetime 

• An analytical expression was presented that relates k s to both temperature and 
stress—see Equation 8.20. 

Data Extrapolation Methods 

• Extrapolation of creep test data to lower temperature/longer time regimes is 
possible using a plot of logarithm of stress versus the Larson-Miller parameter 
for the particular alloy (Figure 8.32). 

Alloys for High-Temperature Use 

• Metal alloys that are especially resistant to creep have high elastic moduli and 
melting temperatures; these include the superalloys, the stainless steels, and the 
refractory metals. Various processing techniques are employed to improve the 
creep properties of these materials.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 


Principles of Fracture Mechanics 

8.1 What is the magnitude of the maximum stress 
that exists at the tip of an internal crack having 
a radius of curvature of 2.5 X 10 -4 mm 
(10 -5 in.) and a crack length of 2.5 X 10 -2 mm 
(10 -3 in.) when a tensile stress of 170 MPa 
(25,000 psi) is applied? 

8.2 Estimate the theoretical fracture strength of 
a brittle material if it is known that fracture 
occurs by the propagation of an elliptically 
shaped surface crack of length 0.25 mm (0.01 
in.) and having a tip radius of curvature of 1.2 
X 10 -3 mm (4.7 X 10 -5 in.) when a stress of 
1200 MPa (174,000 psi) is applied. 

8.3 If the specific surface energy for soda-lime 
glass is 0.30 J/m 2 , using data contained in 
Table 12.5, compute the critical stress re¬ 
quired for the propagation of a surface crack 
of length 0.05 mm. 


8.4 A polystyrene component must not fail when 
a tensile stress of 1.25 MPa (180 psi) is applied. 
Determine the maximum allowable surface 
crack length if the surface energy of poly¬ 
styrene is 0.50 J/m 2 (2.86 X 10 -3 in.-lb f /in. 2 ). 
Assume a modulus of elasticity of 3.0 GPa 
(0.435 X 10 6 psi). 

8.5 A specimen of a 4340 steel alloy having a 
plane strain fracture toughness of 45 MPa Vm 
(41 ksi Vim) is exposed to a stress of 1000 
MPa (145,000 psi). Will this specimen experi¬ 
ence fracture if it is known that the largest 
surface crack is 0.75 mm (0.03 in.) long? Why 
or why not? Assume that the parameter Y has 
a value of 1.0. 

8.6 An aircraft component is fabricated from an 
aluminum alloy that has a plane strain frac¬ 
ture toughness of 35 MPaVm (31.9 ksi Vim). 
It has been determined that fracture results 
at a stress of 250 MPa (36,250 psi) when the 




276 * Chapter 8 / Failure 


maximum (or critical) internal crack length is 
2.0 mm (0.08 in.). For this same component 
and alloy, will fracture occur at a stress level 
of 325 MPa (47,125 psi) when the maximum 
internal crack length is 1.0 mm (0.04 in.)? Why 
or why not? 

8.7 Suppose that a wing component on an air¬ 
craft is fabricated from an aluminum alloy 
that has a plane strain fracture toughness of 
40 MPaVm (36.4 ksiVm.). It has been deter¬ 
mined that fracture results at a stress of 365 
MPa (53,000 psi) when the maximum internal 
crack length is 2.5 mm (0.10 in.). For this same 
component and alloy, compute the stress level 
at which fracture will occur for a critical in¬ 
ternal crack length of 4.0 mm (0.16 in.). 

8.8 A large plate is fabricated from a steel alloy 
that has a plane strain fracture toughness of 
55 MPaVm (50 ksiVnu). If, during service 
use, the plate is exposed to a tensile stress of 
200 MPa (29,000 psi), determine the minimum 
length of a surface crack that will lead to frac¬ 
ture. Assume a value of 1.0 for Y. 

8.9 Calculate the maximum internal crack length 
allowable for a 7075-T651 aluminum alloy 
(Table 8.1) component that is loaded to a 
stress one-half of its yield strength. Assume 
that the value of Y is 1.35. 

8.10 A structural component in the form of a wide 
plate is to be fabricated from a steel alloy that 
has a plane strain fracture toughness of 
77.0 MPaVm (70.1 ksi VuL) and a yield str¬ 
ength of 1400 MPa (205,000 psi).The flaw size 
resolution limit of the flaw detection appara¬ 
tus is 4.0 mm (0.16 in.). If the design stress is 
one-half of the yield strength and the value of 
Y is 1.0, determine whether a critical flaw for 
this plate is subject to detection.

a brief report on one or two nondestructive 
test techniques that are used to detect and 
measure internal and/or surface flaws in metal 
alloys.

Stress and Temperature Effects 

8.28 A specimen 750 mm (30 in.) long of an S-590 
alloy (Figure 8.31) is to be exposed to a tensile 
stress of 80 MPa (11,600 psi) at 815°C (1500°F). 
Determine its elongation after 5000 h. Assume 
that the total of both instantaneous and pri¬ 
mary creep elongations is 1.5 mm (0.06 in.).

8.31) originally 10 mm (0.40 in.) in diameter 
and 500 mm (20 in.) long, what tensile load is 
necessary to produce a total elongation of 145 
mm (5.7 in.) after 2,000 h at 730°C (1350°F)? 
Assume that the sum of instantaneous and 
primary creep elongations is 8.6 mm (0.34 in.). 

8.30 If a component fabricated from an S-590 alloy 
(Figure 8.30) is to be exposed to a tensile stress 
of 300 MPa (43,500 psi) at 650°C (1200°F),

925°C (1700°F). 

8.32 From Equation 8.19, if the logarithm of e s is 
plotted versus the logarithm of cr, then a 
straight line should result, the slope of which 
is the stress exponent n. Using Figure 8.31, 
determine the value of n for the S-590 alloy

temperature) straight line segments at each of 
650°C, 730°C, and 815°C.

tomobile repair shop, a machine shop, and so 
on. Conduct an investigation to determine 
the cause and type of failure (i.e., simple frac¬ 
ture, fatigue, creep). In addition, propose 
measures that can be taken to prevent future 
incidents of this type of failure. Finally, sub¬

WHY STUDY Phase Diagrams? 


One reason that a knowledge and understanding of 
phase diagrams is important to the engineer relates to 
the design and control of heat-treating procedures; 
some properties of materials are functions of their mi¬ 
crostructures, and, consequently, of their thermal his¬ 
tories. Even though most phase diagrams represent 
stable (or equilibrium) states and microstructures, they 
are nevertheless useful in understanding the develop¬ 
ment and preservation of nonequilibrium structures 
and their attendant properties; it is often the case 
that these properties are more desirable than those 
associated with the equilibrium state. This is aptly 


illustrated by the phenomenon of precipitation hard¬ 
ening (Section 11.9). 

In the processing/structure/properties/perform- 
ance scheme, reasons for studying phase diagrams are 
as follows: 

• Concepts discussed in this chapter provide a foun¬ 
dation that is necessary for us to understand phase 
transformations that occur in steel alloys, as well as 
the consequences of these transformations—that is, 
microstructural and property alterations (as present¬ 
ed in Chapter 10). 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. (a) Schematically sketch simple isomorphous 

and eutectic phase diagrams. 

(b) On these diagrams label the various phase 4. 
regions.

2. Given a binary phase diagram, the composition 
of an alloy, its temperature, and assuming that 
the alloy is at equilibrium, determine 

(a) what phase(s) is (are) present, 

(b) the composition(s) of the phase(s), and 

(c) the mass fraction(s) of the phase(s). 

3. For some given binary phase diagram, do the 
following: 

(a) locate the temperatures and compositions of 
all eutectic, eutectoid, peritectic, and con¬ 
gruent phase transformations; and 


(b) write reactions for all these transformations 
for either heating or cooling.

containing between 0.022 wt% C and 2.14 wt% C, 
be able to 

(a) specify whether the alloy is hypoeutectoid 
or hypereutectoid, 

(b) name the proeutectoid phase, 

(c) compute the mass fractions of proeutectoid 
phase and pearlite, and 

(d) make a schematic diagram of the microstruc¬ 
ture at a temperature just below the 
eutectoid. 


9.1 INTRODUCTION 

The understanding of phase diagrams for alloy systems is extremely important 
because there is a strong correlation between microstructure and mechanical 
properties, and the development of microstructure of an alloy is related to the char¬ 
acteristics of its phase diagram. In addition, phase diagrams provide valuable 
information about melting, casting, crystallization, and other phenomena. 

This chapter presents and discusses the following topics: (1) terminology asso¬ 
ciated with phase diagrams and phase transformations; (2) pressure-temperature 
phase diagrams for pure materials; (3) the interpretation of phase diagrams; (4) 
some of the common and relatively simple binary phase diagrams, including that 
for the iron-carbon system; and (5) the development of equilibrium microstruc¬ 
tures, upon cooling, for several situations.

9.2 Solubility Limit * 283 


Definitions and Basic Concepts 

It is necessary to establish a foundation of definitions and basic concepts relating 
to alloys, phases, and equilibrium before delving into the interpretation and uti¬ 
lization of phase diagrams. The term component is frequently used in this discus¬ 
sion; components are pure metals and/or compounds of which an ahoy is composed. 
For example, in a copper-zinc brass, the components are Cu and Zn. Solute and sol¬ 
vent, which are also common terms, were defined in Section 4.3. Another term used 
in this context is system, which has two meanings. First, system may refer to a spe¬ 
cific body of material under consideration (e.g., a ladle of molten steel). Or it may 
relate to the series of possible alloys consisting of the same components, but with¬ 
out regard to ahoy composition (e.g., the iron-carbon system). 

The concept of a solid solution was introduced in Section 4.3. By way of review, 
a solid solution consists of atoms of at least two different types; the solute atoms 
occupy either substitutional or interstitial positions in the solvent lattice, and the 
crystal structure of the solvent is maintained. 

9.2 SOLUBILITY LIMIT 

For many alloy systems and at some specific temperature, there is a maximum con¬ 
centration of solute atoms that may dissolve in the solvent to form a solid solution; this 
solubility limit is called a solubility limit. The addition of solute in excess of this solubility limit results 

in the formation of another solid solution or compound that has a distinctly different 
composition. To illustrate this concept, consider the sugar-water (C^H^On-F^O) sys¬ 
tem. Initially, as sugar is added to water, a sugar-water solution or syrup forms. As more 
sugar is introduced, the solution becomes more concentrated, until the solubility limit 
is reached or the solution becomes saturated with sugar. At this time the solution is 
not capable of dissolving any more sugar, and further additions simply settle to the bot¬ 
tom of the container. Thus, the system now consists of two separate substances: a 
sugar-water syrup liquid solution and solid crystals of undissolved sugar. 

This solubility limit of sugar in water depends on the temperature of the water 
and may be represented in graphical form on a plot of temperature along the or¬ 
dinate and composition (in weight percent sugar) along the abscissa, as shown in 
Figure 9.1. Along the composition axis, increasing sugar concentration is from left 
to right, and percentage of water is read from right to left. Because only two

components are involved (sugar and water), the sum of the concentrations at any 
composition will equal 100 wt%. The solubility limit is represented as the nearly 
vertical line in the figure. For compositions and temperatures to the left of the sol¬ 
ubility line, only the syrup liquid solution exists; to the right of the line, syrup and 
solid sugar coexist. The solubility limit at some temperature is the composition that 
corresponds to the intersection of the given temperature coordinate and the sol¬ 
ubility limit line. For example, at 20°C the maximum solubility of sugar in water is 
65 wt%. As Figure 9.1 indicates, the solubility limit increases slightly with rising 
temperature. 


9.3 PHASES 

phase Also critical to the understanding of phase diagrams is the concept of a phase. A 

phase may be defined as a homogeneous portion of a system that has uniform phys¬ 
ical and chemical characteristics. Every pure material is considered to be a phase; 
so also is every solid, liquid, and gaseous solution. For example, the sugar-water 
syrup solution just discussed is one phase, and solid sugar is another. Each has dif¬ 
ferent physical properties (one is a liquid, the other is a solid); furthermore, each is 
different chemically (i.e., has a different chemical composition); one is virtually pure 
sugar, the other is a solution of H 2 0 and C^FI^On. If more than one phase is pres¬ 
ent in a given system, each will have its own distinct properties, and a boundary 
separating the phases will exist across which there will be a discontinuous and abrupt 
change in physical and/or chemical characteristics. When two phases are present in 
a system, it is not necessary that there be a difference in both physical and chemi¬ 
cal properties; a disparity in one or the other set of properties is sufficient. When 
water and ice are present in a container, two separate phases exist; they are physi¬ 
cally dissimilar (one is a solid, the other is a liquid) but identical in chemical makeup. 
Also, when a substance can exist in two or more polymorphic forms (e.g., having 
both FCC and BCC structures), each of these structures is a separate phase because 
their respective physical characteristics differ. 

Sometimes, a single-phase system is termed homogeneous. Systems composed 
of two or more phases are termed mixtures or heterogeneous systems. Most metal¬ 
lic alloys and, for that matter, ceramic, polymeric, and composite systems are 
heterogeneous. Ordinarily, the phases interact in such a way that the property com¬ 
bination of the multiphase system is different from, and more attractive than, either 
of the individual phases. 


9.4 MICROSTRUCTURE 

Many times, the physical properties and, in particular, the mechanical behavior of 
a material depend on the microstructure. Microstructure is subject to direct micro¬ 
scopic observation, using optical or electron microscopes; this topic was touched on 
in Sections 4.9 and 4.10. In metal alloys, microstructure is characterized by the num¬ 
ber of phases present, their proportions, and the manner in which they are distrib¬ 
uted or arranged. The microstructure of an alloy depends on such variables as the 
alloying elements present, their concentrations, and the heat treatment of the alloy 
(i.e., the temperature, the heating time at temperature, and the rate of cooling to 
room temperature). 

The procedure of specimen preparation for microscopic examination was briefly 
outlined in Section 4.10. After appropriate polishing and etching, the different 
phases may be distinguished by their appearance. For example, for a two-phase 


9.5 Phase Equilibria * 285 


alloy, one phase may appear light and the other phase dark. When only a single phase 
or solid solution is present, the texture will be uniform, except for grain boundaries 
that may be revealed (Figure 4.14 b). 

9.5 PHASE EQUILIBRIA 

Equilibrium is another essential concept that is best described in terms of a ther¬ 
modynamic quantity called the free energy. In brief, free energy is a function of the 
internal energy of a system, and also the randomness or disorder of the atoms or 
molecules (or entropy). A system is at equilibrium if its free energy is at a mini¬ 
mum under some specified combination of temperature, pressure, and composition. 
In a macroscopic sense, this means that the characteristics of the system do not 
change with time but persist indefinitely; that is, the system is stable. A change in 
temperature, pressure, and/or composition for a system in equilibrium will result in 
an increase in the free energy and in a possible spontaneous change to another state 
whereby the free energy is lowered, 
phase equilibrium The term phase equilibrium, often used in the context of this discussion, refers 

to equilibrium as it applies to systems in which more than one phase may exist. 
Phase equilibrium is reflected by a constancy with time in the phase characteristics 
of a system. Perhaps an example best illustrates this concept. Suppose that a 
sugar-water syrup is contained in a closed vessel and the solution is in contact with 
solid sugar at 20°C. If the system is at equilibrium, the composition of the syrup is 
65 wt% C 12 H220 n -35 wt% H 2 0 (Figure 9.1), and the amounts and compositions 
of the syrup and solid sugar will remain constant with time. If the temperature of 
the system is suddenly raised—say, to 100°C—this equilibrium or balance is tem¬ 
porarily upset in that the solubility limit has been increased to 80 wt% C^FI^On 
(Figure 9.1). Thus, some of the solid sugar will go into solution in the syrup. This 
will continue until the new equilibrium syrup concentration is established at the 
higher temperature. 

This sugar-syrup example illustrates the principle of phase equilibrium using a 
liquid-solid system. In many metallurgical and materials systems of interest, phase 
equilibrium involves just solid phases. In this regard the state of the system is re¬ 
flected in the characteristics of the microstructure, which necessarily include not 
only the phases present and their compositions but, in addition, the relative phase 
amounts and their spatial arrangement or distribution. 

Free energy considerations and diagrams similar to Figure 9.1 provide infor¬ 
mation about the equilibrium characteristics of a particular system, which is im¬ 
portant, but they do not indicate the time period necessary for the attainment of a 
new equilibrium state. It is often the case, especially in solid systems, that a state of 
equilibrium is never completely achieved because the rate of approach to equilib- 
metastable rium is extremely slow; such a system is said to be in a nonequilibrium or metastable 

state. A metastable state or microstructure may persist indefinitely, experiencing 
only extremely slight and almost imperceptible changes as time progresses. Often, 
metastable structures are of more practical significance than equilibrium ones. For 
example, some steel and aluminum alloys rely for their strength on the develop¬ 
ment of metastable microstructures during carefully designed heat treatments (Sec¬ 
tions 10.5 and 11.9). 

Thus not only is an understanding of equilibrium states and structures impor¬ 
tant, but also the speed or rate at which they are established and the factors that 
affect the rate must be considered. This chapter is devoted almost exclusively to 
equilibrium structures; the treatment of reaction rates and nonequilibrium struc¬ 
tures is deferred to Chapter 10 and Section 11.9.

9.6 ONE-COMPONENT (OR UNARY) 

PHASE DIAGRAMS 

Much of the information about the control of the phase structure of a particular 
phase diagram system is conveniently and concisely displayed in what is called a phase diagram, 

also often termed an equilibrium diagram. Now, there are three externally control¬ 
lable parameters that will affect phase structure—temperature, pressure, and com¬ 
position—and phase diagrams are constructed when various combinations of these 
parameters are plotted against one another. 

Perhaps the simplest and easiest type of phase diagram to understand is that 
for a one-component system, in which composition is held constant (i.e., the phase 
diagram is for a pure substance); this means that pressure and temperature are the 
variables. This one-component phase diagram (or unary phase diagram) [sometimes 
also called a pressure-temperature (or P-T) diagram ] is represented as a two- 
dimensional plot of pressure (ordinate, or vertical axis) versus temperature (ab¬ 
scissa, or horizontal axis). Most often, the pressure axis is scaled logarithmically. 

We illustrate this type of phase diagram and demonstrate its interpretation us¬ 
ing as an example the one for H 2 0, which is shown in Figure 9.2. Here it may be 
noted that regions for three different phases—solid, liquid, and vapor—are delin¬ 
eated on the plot. Each of the phases will exist under equilibrium conditions over 
the temperature-pressure ranges of its corresponding area. Furthermore, the three 
curves shown on the plot (labeled aO , bO , and cO ) are phase boundaries; at any 
point on one of these curves, the two phases on either side of the curve are in equi¬ 
librium (or coexist) with one another. That is, equilibrium between solid and vapor

Intersection of the dashed horizontal line at 1 atm pressure with 
the solid-liquid phase boundary (point 2) corresponds to the 
melting point at this pressure (T = 0°C). Similarly, point 3, the 
intersection with the liquid-vapor boundary, represents the 
boiling point (T = 100°C). 








9.7 Binary Isomorphous Systems * 287 


phases is along curve aO —likewise for the solid-liquid, curve bO , and the liquid- 
vapor, curve cO. Also, upon crossing a boundary (as temperature and/or pressure is 
altered), one phase transforms to another. For example, at 1 atm pressure, during 
heating the solid phase transforms to the liquid phase (i.e., melting occurs) at the 
point labeled 2 on Figure 9.2 (i.e., the intersection of the dashed horizontal line with 
the solid-liquid phase boundary); this point corresponds to a temperature of 0°C. Of 
course, the reverse transformation (liquid-to-solid, or solidification) takes place at 
the same point upon cooling. Similarly, at the intersection of the dashed line with 
the liquid-vapor phase boundary [point 3 (Figure 9.2), at 100°C] the liquid trans¬ 
forms to the vapor phase (or vaporizes) upon heating; condensation occurs for cool¬ 
ing. And, finally, solid ice sublimes or vaporizes upon crossing the curve labeled aO. 

As may also be noted from Figure 9.2, all three of the phase boundary curves 
intersect at a common point, which is labeled O (and for this H 2 0 system, at a tem¬ 
perature of 273.16 K and a pressure of 6.04 X 1CT 3 atm). This means that at this 
point only, all of the solid, liquid, and vapor phases are simultaneously in equilib¬ 
rium with one another. Appropriately, this, and any other point on a P-T phase di¬ 
agram where three phases are in equilibrium, is called a triple point; sometimes it 
is also termed an invariant point inasmuch as its position is distinct, or fixed by def¬ 
inite values of pressure and temperature. Any deviation from this point by a change 
of temperature and/or pressure will cause at least one of the phases to disappear. 

Pressure-temperature phase diagrams for a number of substances have been de¬ 
termined experimentally, which also have solid, liquid, and vapor phase regions. In 
those instances when multiple solid phases (i.e., allotropes, Section 3.6) exist, there 
will appear a region on the diagram for each solid phase, and also other triple points. 

Binary Phase Diagrams 

Another type of extremely common phase diagram is one in which temperature 
and composition are variable parameters, and pressure is held constant—normally 
1 atm. There are several different varieties; in the present discussion, we will con¬ 
cern ourselves with binary alloys—those that contain two components. If more than 
two components are present, phase diagrams become extremely complicated and 
difficult to represent. An explanation of the principles governing and the interpre¬ 
tation of phase diagrams can be demonstrated using binary alloys even though most 
alloys contain more than two components. 

Binary phase diagrams are maps that represent the relationships between tem¬ 
perature and the compositions and quantities of phases at equilibrium, which in¬ 
fluence the microstructure of an alloy. Many microstructures develop from phase 
transformations, the changes that occur when the temperature is altered (ordinar¬ 
ily upon cooling). This may involve the transition from one phase to another, or the 
appearance or disappearance of a phase. Binary phase diagrams are helpful in pre¬ 
dicting phase transformations and the resulting microstructures, which may have 
equilibrium or nonequilibrium character. 


9.7 BINARY ISOMORPHOUS SYSTEMS 

Possibly the easiest type of binary phase diagram to understand and interpret is the 
type that is characterized by the copper-nickel system (Figure 9.3a). Temperature 
is plotted along the ordinate, and the abscissa represents the composition of the al¬ 
loy, in weight percent (bottom) and atom percent (top) of nickel. The composition

ranges from 0 wt% Ni (100 wt% Cu) on the left horizontal extremity to 100 wt% 
Ni (0 wt% Cu) on the right. Three different phase regions, or fields, appear on the 
diagram, an alpha (a) field, a liquid (L) field, and a two-phase a + L field. Each 
region is defined by the phase or phases that exist over the range of temperatures 
and compositions delineated by the phase boundary lines. 















9.8 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams * 289 

The liquid L is a homogeneous liquid solution composed of both copper and 
nickel. The a phase is a substitutional solid solution consisting of both Cu and Ni 
atoms, and having an FCC crystal structure. At temperatures below about 1080°C, 
copper and nickel are mutually soluble in each other in the solid state for all com¬ 
positions. This complete solubility is explained by the fact that both Cu and Ni have 
the same crystal structure (FCC), nearly identical atomic radii and electronegativ¬ 
ities, and similar valences, as discussed in Section 4.3. The copper-nickel system is 
isomorphous termed isomorphous because of this complete liquid and solid solubility of the two 

components. 

A couple of comments are in order regarding nomenclature. First, for metallic 
alloys, solid solutions are commonly designated by lowercase Greek letters ( a , /3, 
y, etc.). Furthermore, with regard to phase boundaries, the line separating the L 
and a + L phase fields is termed the liquidus line, as indicated in Figure 9.3a; the 
liquid phase is present at all temperatures and compositions above this line. The 
solidus line is located between the a and a + L regions, below which only the solid 
a phase exists. 

For Figure 9.3a, the solidus and liquidus lines intersect at the two composition 
extremities; these correspond to the melting temperatures of the pure components. 
For example, the melting temperatures of pure copper and nickel are 1085°C and 
1453°C, respectively. Heating pure copper corresponds to moving vertically up the 
left-hand temperature axis. Copper remains solid until its melting temperature is 
reached. The solid-to-liquid transformation takes place at the melting temperature, 
and no further heating is possible until this transformation has been completed. 

For any composition other than pure components, this melting phenomenon 
will occur over the range of temperatures between the solidus and liquidus lines; 
both solid a and liquid phases will be in equilibrium within this temperature range. 
For example, upon heating an alloy of composition 50 wt% Ni-50 wt% Cu (Fig¬ 
ure 9.3a), melting begins at approximately 1280°C (2340°F); the amount of liquid 
phase continuously increases with temperature until about 1320°C (2410°F), at 
which the alloy is completely liquid. 


9.8 INTERPRETATION OF PHASE DIAGRAMS 

For a binary system of known composition and temperature that is at equilibrium, 
at least three kinds of information are available: (1) the phases that are present, (2) 
the compositions of these phases, and (3) the percentages or fractions of the phases. 
The procedures for making these determinations will be demonstrated using the 
copper-nickel system. 


Phases Present 


VMSE 



Isomorphous (Sb-Bi) 


The establishment of what phases are present is relatively simple. One just locates 
the temperature-composition point on the diagram and notes the phase(s) with 
which the corresponding phase field is labeled. For example, an alloy of composi¬ 
tion 60 wt% Ni-40 wt% Cu at 1100°C would be located at point A in Figure 9.3a; 
because this is within the a region, only the single a phase will be present. On the 
other hand, a 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu alloy at 1250°C (point B ) will consist of both 
a and liquid phases at equilibrium. 


Determination of Phase Compositions 

The first step in the determination of phase compositions (in terms of the concen¬ 
trations of the components) is to locate the temperature-composition point on the

Phase Diagrams 

phase diagram. Different methods are used for single- and two-phase regions. If 
only one phase is present, the procedure is trivial: the composition of this phase is 
simply the same as the overall composition of the alloy. For example, consider the 
60 wt% Ni-40 wt% Cu alloy at 1100°C (point A , Figure 9.3a). At this composition 
and temperature, only the a phase is present, having a composition of 60 wt% Ni- 
40 wt% Cu. 

For an alloy having composition and temperature located in a two-phase re¬ 
gion, the situation is more complicated. In all two-phase regions (and in two-phase 
regions only), one may imagine a series of horizontal lines, one at every tempera¬ 
ture; each of these is known as a tie line, or sometimes as an isotherm. These tie 
lines extend across the two-phase region and terminate at the phase boundary lines 
on either side. To compute the equilibrium concentrations of the two phases, the 
following procedure is used: 

1. A tie line is constructed across the two-phase region at the temperature of 
the alloy. 

2. The intersections of the tie line and the phase boundaries on either side are 
noted. 

3. Perpendiculars are dropped from these intersections to the horizontal composi¬ 
tion axis, from which the composition of each of the respective phases is read. 

For example, consider again the 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu alloy at 1250°C, lo¬ 
cated at point B in Figure 93b and lying within the a + L region. Thus, the problem 
is to determine the composition (in wt% Ni and Cu) for both the a and liquid 
phases. The tie line has been constructed across the a + L phase region, as shown 
in Figure 93b. The perpendicular from the intersection of the tie line with the 
liquidus boundary meets the composition axis at 31.5 wt% Ni-68.5 wt% Cu, which 
is the composition of the liquid phase, C L . Likewise, for the solidus-tie line inter¬ 
section, we find a composition for the a solid-solution phase, C a , of 42.5 wt% 
Ni-57.5 wt% Cu. 


Determination of Phase Amounts 

The relative amounts (as fraction or as percentage) of the phases present at equi¬ 
librium may also be computed with the aid of phase diagrams. Again, the single- 
and two-phase situations must be treated separately. The solution is obvious in the 
single-phase region: because only one phase is present, the alloy is composed en¬ 
tirely of that phase; that is, the phase fraction is 1.0 or, alternatively, the percentage 
is 100%. From the previous example for the 60 wt% Ni-40 wt% Cu alloy at 1100°C 
(point A in Figure 9.3a), only the a phase is present; hence, the alloy is completely 
or 100% a. 

If the composition and temperature position is located within a two-phase re¬ 
gion, things are more complex. The tie line must be utilized in conjunction with a 
procedure that is often called the lever rule (or the inverse lever rule), which is ap¬ 
plied as follows: 

1. The tie line is constructed across the two-phase region at the temperature of 
the alloy. 

2. The overall alloy composition is located on the tie line. 

3. The fraction of one phase is computed by taking the length of tie line from 
the overall alloy composition to the phase boundary for the other phase, and 
dividing by the total tie line length. 






9.8 Interpretation of Phase Diagrams * 291 


4. The fraction of the other phase is determined in the same manner. 

5. If phase percentages are desired, each phase fraction is multiplied by 100. When 
the composition axis is scaled in weight percent, the phase fractions computed 
using the lever rule are mass fractions—the mass (or weight) of a specific phase 
divided by the total alloy mass (or weight). The mass of each phase is computed 
from the product of each phase fraction and the total alloy mass. 

In the employment of the lever rule, tie line segment lengths may be deter¬ 
mined either by direct measurement from the phase diagram using a linear scale, 
preferably graduated in millimeters, or by subtracting compositions as taken from 
the composition axis. 

Consider again the example shown in Figure 93b, in which at 1250°C both a 
and liquid phases are present for a 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu alloy. The problem is to 
compute the fraction of each of the a and liquid phases. The tie line has been con¬ 
structed that was used for the determination of a and L phase compositions. Let 
the overall alloy composition be located along the tie line and denoted as C 0 , and 
mass fractions be represented by W L and W a for the respective phases. From the 
lever rule, W L may be computed according to

Composition need be specified in terms of only one of the constituents for a binary 
alloy; for the preceding computation, weight percent nickel will be used (i.e., C 0 = 
35 wt% Ni, C a = 42.5 wt% Ni, and C L = 31.5 wt% Ni), and

Of course, identical answers are obtained if compositions are expressed in weight 
percent copper instead of nickel. 

Thus, the lever rule may be employed to determine the relative amounts or 
fractions of phases in any two-phase region for a binary alloy if the temperature 
and composition are known and if equilibrium has been established. Its derivation 
is presented as an example problem. 








292 * Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams 

It is easy to confuse the foregoing procedures for the determination of phase 
compositions and fractional phase amounts; thus, a brief summary is warranted. 
Compositions of phases are expressed in terms of weight percents of the compo¬ 
nents (e.g., wt% Cu, wt% Ni). For any alloy consisting of a single phase, the com¬ 
position of that phase is the same as the total alloy composition. If two phases are 
present, the tie line must be employed, the extremities of which determine the com¬ 
positions of the respective phases. With regard to fractional phase amounts (e.g., 
mass fraction of the a or liquid phase), when a single phase exists, the alloy is com¬ 
pletely that phase. For a two-phase alloy, on the other hand, the lever rule is uti¬ 
lized, in which a ratio of tie line segment lengths is taken.

Lever Rule Derivation

Solution 

Consider the phase diagram for copper and nickel (Figure 93b) and alloy of 
composition C 0 at 1250°C, and let C a , C L , W a , and W L represent the same pa¬ 
rameters as given earlier. This derivation is accomplished through two 
conservation-of-mass expressions. With the first, because only two phases are 
present, the sum of their mass fractions must be equal to unity; that is, 

W, + W L = 1 (9.3) 

For the second, the mass of one of the components (either Cu or Ni) that is 
present in both of the phases must be equal to the mass of that component in 
the total alloy, or

For multiphase alloys, it is often more convenient to specify relative phase 
amount in terms of volume fraction rather than mass fraction. Phase volume frac¬ 
tions are preferred because they (rather than mass fractions) may be determined 
from examination of the microstructure; furthermore, the properties of a multiphase 
alloy may be estimated on the basis of volume fractions. 

For an alloy consisting of a and (3 phases, the volume fraction of the a phase, 
V a , is defined as 


a phase volume 
fraction—dependence 
on volumes of a and 
f3 phases

where v a and denote the volumes of the respective phases in the alloy. Of course, 
an analogous expression exists for Vjg, and, for an alloy consisting of just two phases, 
it is the case that V a + Vp = 1. 

On occasion conversion from mass fraction to volume fraction (or vice versa) 
is desired. Equations that facilitate these conversions are as follows:

In these expressions, p a and p fi are the densities of the respective phases; these may

When the densities of the phases in a two-phase alloy differ significantly, there 
will be quite a disparity between mass and volume fractions; conversely, if the phase 
densities are the same, mass and volume fractions are identical. 

9.9 DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN 
ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS 


VMSE 



Isomorphous (Sb-Bi) 


Equilibrium Cooling 

At this point it is instructive to examine the development of microstructure that 
occurs for isomorphous alloys during solidification. We first treat the situation in 
which the cooling occurs very slowly, in that phase equilibrium is continuously 
maintained. 

Let us consider the copper-nickel system (Figure 9.3a), specifically an alloy of 
composition 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu as it is cooled from 1300°C. The region of the 
Cu-Ni phase diagram in the vicinity of this composition is shown in Figure 9.4. 
Cooling of an alloy of this composition corresponds to moving down the vertical 
dashed line. At 1300°C, point a, the alloy is completely liquid (of composition 
35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu) and has the microstructure represented by the circle in¬ 
set in the figure. As cooling begins, no microstructural or compositional changes 
will be realized until we reach the liquidus line (point b , ~1260°C). At this point,

Composition (wt% Ni) 









9.9 Development of Microstructure in Isomorphous Alloys * 295 

the first solid a begins to form, which has a composition dictated by the tie line 
drawn at this temperature [i.e., 46 wt% Ni-54 wt% Cu, noted as 46 Ni)]; the 
composition of liquid is still approximately 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu [L(35 Ni)], 
which is different from that of the solid a. With continued cooling, both compo¬ 
sitions and relative amounts of each of the phases will change. The compositions 
of the liquid and a phases will follow the liquidus and solidus lines, respectively. 
Furthermore, the fraction of the a phase will increase with continued cooling. 
Note that the overall alloy composition (35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu) remains 
unchanged during cooling even though there is a redistribution of copper and 
nickel between the phases. 

At 1250°C, point c in Figure 9.4, the compositions of the liquid and a phases 
are 32 wt% Ni-68 wt% Cu [L(32 Ni)] and 43 wt% Ni-57 wt% Cu [a(43 Ni)], re¬ 
spectively. 

The solidification process is virtually complete at about 1220°C, point d\ the com¬ 
position of the solid a is approximately 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu (the overall alloy 
composition), whereas that of the last remaining liquid is 24 wt% Ni-76 wt% Cu. 
Upon crossing the solidus line, this remaining liquid solidifies; the final product then 
is a polycrystalline a-phase solid solution that has a uniform 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu 
composition (point e, Figure 9.4). Subsequent cooling will produce no microstruc- 
tural or compositional alterations. 

Nonequilibrium Cooling 

Conditions of equilibrium solidification and the development of microstructures, 
as described in the previous section, are realized only for extremely slow cooling 
rates. The reason for this is that with changes in temperature, there must be read¬ 
justments in the compositions of the liquid and solid phases in accordance with 
the phase diagram (i.e., with the liquidus and solidus lines), as discussed. These 
readjustments are accomplished by diffusional processes—that is, diffusion in both 
solid and liquid phases and also across the solid-liquid interface. Inasmuch as dif¬ 
fusion is a time-dependent phenomenon (Section 5.3), to maintain equilibrium 
during cooling, sufficient time must be allowed at each temperature for the ap¬ 
propriate compositional readjustments. Diffusion rates (i.e., the magnitudes of the 
diffusion coefficients) are especially low for the solid phase and, for both phases, 
decrease with diminishing temperature. In virtually all practical solidification sit¬ 
uations, cooling rates are much too rapid to allow these compositional readjust¬ 
ments and maintenance of equilibrium; consequently, microstructures other than 
those previously described develop. 

Some of the consequences of nonequilibrium solidification for isomorphous al¬ 
loys will now be discussed by considering a 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% Cu alloy, the same 
composition that was used for equilibrium cooling in the previous section. The por¬ 
tion of the phase diagram near this composition is shown in Figure 9.5; in addition, 
microstructures and associated phase compositions at various temperatures upon 
cooling are noted in the circular insets. To simplify this discussion it will be assumed 
that diffusion rates in the liquid phase are sufficiently rapid such that equilibrium 
is maintained in the liquid. 

Let us begin cooling from a temperature of about 1300°C; this is indicated by 
point a' in the liquid region. This liquid has a composition of 35 wt% Ni-65 wt% 
Cu [noted as L(35 Ni) in the figure], and no changes occur while cooling through 
the liquid phase region (moving down vertically from point a'). At point b' (ap¬ 
proximately 1260°C), a-phase particles begin to form, which, from the tie line con¬ 
structed, have a composition of 46 wt% Ni-54 wt% Cu [a (46 Ni)].

representation of the

solidification of a 35

alloy. 



Composition (wt% Ni) 


Upon further cooling to point d (about 1240°C), the liquid composition has 
shifted to 29 wt% Ni-71 wt% Cu; furthermore, at this temperature the composition 
of the a phase that solidified is 40 wt% Ni-60 wt% Cu [a (40 Ni)]. However, because 
diffusion in the solid a phase is relatively slow, the a phase that formed at point b' 
has not changed composition appreciably—that is, it is still about 46 wt% Ni—and 
the composition of the a grains has continuously changed with radial position, from 
46 wt% Ni at grain centers to 40 wt% Ni at the outer grain perimeters. Thus, at 
point c', the average composition of the solid a grains that have formed would be 
some volume weighted average composition, lying between 46 and 40 wt% Ni. For 
the sake of argument, let us take this average composition to be 42 wt% Ni-58 wt% 
Cu [a(42 Ni)]. Furthermore, we would also find that, on the basis of lever-rule 
computations, a greater proportion of liquid is present for these nonequilibrium 
conditions than for equilibrium cooling. The implication of this nonequilibrium 
solidification phenomenon is that the solidus line on the phase diagram has been 
shifted to higher Ni contents—to the average compositions of the a phase (e.g., 42 
wt% Ni at 1240°C)—and is represented by the dashed line in Figure 9.5. There is 
no comparable alteration of the liquidus line inasmuch as it is assumed that 









9.10 Mechanical Properties of Isomorphous Alloys * 297 


equilibrium is maintained in the liquid phase during cooling because of sufficiently 
rapid diffusion rates. 

At point d' (~1220°C) and for equilibrium cooling rates, solidification should 
be completed. However, for this nonequilibrium situation, there is still an appre¬ 
ciable proportion of liquid remaining, and the a phase that is forming has a com¬ 
position of 35 wt% Ni [a(35 Ni)]; also the average a-phase composition at this point 
is 38 wt% Ni [a(38 Ni)]. 

Nonequilibrium solidification finally reaches completion at point e' (~1205°C). 
The composition of the last a phase to solidify at this point is about 31 wt% Ni; 
the average composition of the a phase at complete solidification is 35 wt% Ni. 
The inset at point /' shows the microstructure of the totally solid material. 

The degree of displacement of the nonequilibrium solidus curve from the equi¬ 
librium one will depend on rate of cooling. The slower the cooling rate, the smaller 
this displacement; that is, the difference between the equilibrium solidus and aver¬ 
age solid composition is lower. Furthermore, if the diffusion rate in the solid phase 
is increased, this displacement will be diminished. 

There are some important consequences for isomorphous alloys that have so¬ 
lidified under nonequilibrium conditions. As discussed earlier, the distribution of 
the two elements within the grains is nonuniform, a phenomenon termed segre¬ 
gation; that is, concentration gradients are established across the grains that are 
represented by the insets of Figure 9.5. The center of each grain, which is the first 
part to freeze, is rich in the high-melting element (e.g., nickel for this Cu-Ni sys¬ 
tem), whereas the concentration of the low-melting element increases with posi¬ 
tion from this region to the grain boundary. This is termed a cored structure, which 
gives rise to less than the optimal properties. As a casting having a cored structure 
is reheated, grain boundary regions will melt first inasmuch as they are richer in 
the low-melting component. This produces a sudden loss in mechanical integrity 
due to the thin liquid film that separates the grains. Furthermore, this melting 
may begin at a temperature below the equilibrium solidus temperature of the 
alloy. Coring may be eliminated by a homogenization heat treatment carried out 
at a temperature below the solidus point for the particular alloy composition. 
During this process, atomic diffusion occurs, which produces compositionally 
homogeneous grains. 


9.10 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
ISOMORPHOUS ALLOYS 

We shall now briefly explore how the mechanical properties of solid isomorphous 
alloys are affected by composition as other structural variables (e.g., grain size) are 
held constant. For all temperatures and compositions below the melting tempera¬ 
ture of the lowest-melting component, only a single solid phase will exist. There¬ 
fore, each component will experience solid-solution strengthening (Section 7.9), or 
an increase in strength and hardness by additions of the other component. This ef¬ 
fect is demonstrated in Figure 9.6a as tensile strength versus composition for the 
copper-nickel system at room temperature; at some intermediate composition, the 
curve necessarily passes through a maximum. Plotted in Figure 9 .6b is the ductil¬ 
ity (%EL)-composition behavior, which is just the opposite of tensile strength; 
that is, ductility decreases with additions of the second component, and the curve 
exhibits a minimum.

9.11 BINARY EUTECTIC SYSTEMS 

Another type of common and relatively simple phase diagram found for binary al¬ 
loys is shown in Figure 9.7 for the copper-silver system; this is known as a binary 
eutectic phase diagram. A number of features of this phase diagram are important 
and worth noting. First, three single-phase regions are found on the diagram: a , /3, 
and liquid. The a phase is a solid solution rich in copper; it has silver as the solute

component and an FCC crystal structure. The /3-phase solid solution also has an 
FCC structure, but copper is the solute. Pure copper and pure silver are also con¬ 
sidered to be a and /3 phases, respectively. 

Thus, the solubility in each of these solid phases is limited, in that at any tem¬ 
perature below line BEG only a limited concentration of silver will dissolve in cop¬ 
per (for the a phase), and similarly for copper in silver (for the /3 phase). The 
solubility limit for the a phase corresponds to the boundary line, labeled CBA, be¬ 
tween the a/{a + /3) and at {a + L) phase regions; it increases with temperature to 
a maximum [8.0 wt% Ag at 779°C (1434°F)] at point B , and decreases back to zero 
at the melting temperature of pure copper, point A [1085°C (1985°F)]. At temper¬ 
atures below 779°C (1434°F), the solid solubility limit line separating the a and a 
+ /3 phase regions is termed a solvus line; the boundary AB between the a and a 
+ L fields is the solidus line, as indicated in Figure 9.7. For the f3 phase, both solvus 
and solidus lines also exist, HG and GF , respectively, as shown. The maximum sol¬ 
ubility of copper in the (3 phase, point G (8.8 wt% Cu), also occurs at 779°C (1434°F). 
This horizontal line BEG , which is parallel to the composition axis and extends be¬ 
tween these maximum solubility positions, may also be considered a solidus line; it 
represents the lowest temperature at which a liquid phase may exist for any cop¬ 
per-silver alloy that is at equilibrium. 

There are also three two-phase regions found for the copper-silver system (Fig¬ 
ure 9.7): a + L, (3 + L, and a + (3. The a- and /3-phase solid solutions coexist for 
all compositions and temperatures within the a + /3 phase field; the a + liquid and 
13 + liquid phases also coexist in their respective phase regions. Furthermore, com¬ 
positions and relative amounts for the phases may be determined using tie lines 
and the lever rule as outlined previously. 

As silver is added to copper, the temperature at which the alloys become totally 
liquid decreases along the liquidus line, line AE\ thus, the melting temperature of cop¬ 
per is lowered by silver additions. The same may be said for silver: the introduction of 
copper reduces the temperature of complete melting along the other liquidus line, EE. 
These liquidus lines meet at the point E on the phase diagram, through which also 
passes the horizontal isotherm line BEG. Point E is called an invariant point, which is 
designated by the composition C E and temperature Te, for the copper-silver system, 
the values of C E and T E are 71.9 wt% Ag and 779°C (1434°F), respectively. 

An important reaction occurs for an alloy of composition C E as it changes tem¬ 
perature in passing through Te, this reaction may be written as follows: 

cooling 

L[C e ) ^ a(C aE ) + (i(C jiF ) (9.8) 

heating 


Or, upon cooling, a liquid phase is transformed into the two solid a and /3 phases 
at the temperature T e ; the opposite reaction occurs upon heating. This is called a 
eutectic reaction {eutectic means “easily melted”), and C E and T E represent the eu¬ 
tectic composition and temperature, respectively; C aE and Cp E are the respective 
compositions of the a and (3 phases at T E . Thus, for the copper-silver system, the 
eutectic reaction, Equation 9.8, may be written as follows: 


L(71.9wt% Ag) 


cooling 


heating 


a(8.0wt% Ag) + /3(91.2wt% Ag) 


Often, the horizontal solidus line at T E is called the eutectic isotherm. 






300 * Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams 


The eutectic reaction, upon cooling, is similar to solidification for pure compo¬ 
nents in that the reaction proceeds to completion at a constant temperature, or isother- 
mally, at T E . However, the solid product of eutectic solidification is always two solid 
phases, whereas for a pure component only a single phase forms. Because of this 
eutectic reaction, phase diagrams similar to that in Figure 9.7 are termed eutectic phase 
diagrams’, components exhibiting this behavior comprise a eutectic system. 

In the construction of binary phase diagrams, it is important to understand that 
one or at most two phases may be in equilibrium within a phase field. This holds true 
for the phase diagrams in Figures 9.3a and 9.7. For a eutectic system, three phases {a, 
13, and L) may be in equilibrium, but only at points along the eutectic isotherm. An¬ 
other general rule is that single-phase regions are always separated from each other by 
a two-phase region that consists of the two single phases that it separates. For exam¬ 
ple, the a + /3 field is situated between the a and /3 single-phase regions in Figure 9.7. 

Another common eutectic system is that for lead and tin; the phase diagram 
(Figure 9.8) has a general shape similar to that for copper-silver. For the lead-tin 
system the solid-solution phases are also designated by a and (3; in this case, a 
represents a solid solution of tin in lead and, for /3, tin is the solvent and lead is the 
solute. The eutectic invariant point is located at 61.9 wt% Sn and 183°C (361°F). Of 
course, maximum solid solubility compositions as well as component melting tem¬ 
peratures will be different for the copper-silver and lead-tin systems, as may be 
observed by comparing their phase diagrams. 

On occasion, low-melting-temperature alloys are prepared having near-eutectic 
compositions. A familiar example is the 60-40 solder, containing 60 wt% Sn and

(b) Because two phases are present, it becomes necessary to construct a tie line 
across the a + [3 phase field at 150°C, as indicated in Figure 9.9. The composi¬

for the [3 phase, which will have a composition of approximately 98 wt% 
Sn-2 wt% Pb (C p ).

Relative Phase Amount Determinations—Mass and

For the lead-tin alloy in Example Problem 9.2, calculate the relative amount of 
each phase present in terms of (a) mass fraction and (b) volume fraction. At 
150°C take the densities of Pb and Sn to be 11.23 and 7.24 g/cm 3 , respectively. 


Solution 


(a) Because the alloy consists of two phases, it is necessary to employ the lever 
rule. If Ci denotes the overall alloy composition, mass fractions may be com¬ 
puted by subtracting compositions, in terms of weight percent tin, as follows:

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Lead-Free Solders 


S olders are metal alloys that are used to bond 
or join two or more components (usually other 
metal alloys). They are used extensively in the 
electronics industry to physically hold assemblies 
together; furthermore, they must allow expansion 
and contraction of the various components, must 
transmit electrical signals, and also dissipate any 
heat that is generated. The bonding action is ac¬ 
complished by melting the solder material, allow¬ 
ing it to flow among and make contact with the 
components to be joined (which do not melt), and, 
finally, upon solidification, forming a physical 
bond with all of these components. 

In the past, the vast majority of solders have 
been lead-tin alloys. These materials are reliable and 
inexpensive and have relatively low melting tem¬ 
peratures. The most common lead-tin solder has a 
composition of 63 wt% Sn-37 wt% Pb. According 
to the lead-tin phase diagram, Figure 9.8, this com¬ 
position is near the eutectic and has a melting tem¬ 
perature of about 183°C, the lowest temperature 
possible with the existence of a liquid phase (at 
equilibrium) for the lead-tin system. It follows that 
this alloy is often called a “eutectic lead-tin solder.” 

Unfortunately, lead is a mildly toxic metal, and 
there is serious concern about the environmental 
impact of discarded lead-containing products that 
can leach into groundwater from landfills or pol¬ 
lute the air if incinerated. Consequently, in some 
countries legislation has been enacted that bans 
the use of lead-containing solders. This has forced 
the development of lead-free solders that, among 
other things, must have relatively low melting tem¬ 
peratures (or temperature ranges). Some of these 
are ternary alloys (i.e., composed of three metals), 
to include tin-silver-copper and tin-silver-bismuth 
solders. The compositions of several lead-free 
solders are listed in Table 9.1. 

Of course, melting temperatures (or temper¬ 
ature ranges) are important in the development 
and selection of these new solder alloys, informa¬ 
tion that is available from phase diagrams. For ex¬ 
ample, the tin-bismuth phase diagram is presented 
in Figure 9.10. Here it may be noted that a eutectic

9.12 Development of Microstructure in Eutectic Alloys * 305 


9.12 DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN 
EUTECTIC ALLOYS 

Depending on composition, several different types of microstructures are possible 
for the slow cooling of alloys belonging to binary eutectic systems. These possibili¬ 
ties will be considered in terms of the lead-tin phase diagram, Figure 9.8. 

The first case is for compositions ranging between a pure component and the 
maximum solid solubility for that component at room temperature [20°C (70°F)]. 
For the lead-tin system, this includes lead-rich alloys containing between 0 and 
about 2 wt% Sn (for the a-phase solid solution), and also between approximately 
99 wt% Sn and pure tin (for the (3 phase). For example, consider an alloy of com¬ 
position C] (Figure 9.11) as it is slowly cooled from a temperature within the liquid- 
phase region, say, 350°C; this corresponds to moving down the dashed vertical line 
ww f in the figure. The alloy remains totally liquid and of composition C 1 until we 
cross the liquidus line at approximately 330°C, at which time the solid a phase be¬ 
gins to form. While passing through this narrow a + L phase region, solidification 
proceeds in the same manner as was described for the copper-nickel alloy in the 
preceding section; that is, with continued cooling more of the solid a forms. Fur¬ 
thermore, liquid- and solid-phase compositions are different, which follow along the 
liquidus and solidus phase boundaries, respectively. Solidification reaches comple¬ 
tion at the point where ww ' crosses the solidus line. The resulting alloy is poly¬ 
crystalline with a uniform composition of C 1? and no subsequent changes will occur

upon cooling to room temperature. This microstructure is represented schematically 
by the inset at point c in Figure 9.11. 

The second case considered is for compositions that range between the room 
temperature solubility limit and the maximum solid solubility at the eutectic tem¬ 
perature. For the lead-tin system (Figure 9.8), these compositions extend from about 
2 wt% Sn to 18.3 wt% Sn (for lead-rich alloys) and from 97.8 wt% Sn to approxi¬ 
mately 99 wt% Sn (for tin-rich alloys). Let us examine an alloy of composition C 2 
as it is cooled along the vertical line xx' in Figure 9.12. Down to the intersection of 
xx' and the solvus line, changes that occur are similar to the previous case, as we 
pass through the corresponding phase regions (as demonstrated by the insets at 
points d, e , and /). Just above the solvus intersection, point /, the microstructure 
consists of a grains of composition C 2 . Upon crossing the solvus line, the a solid 
solubility is exceeded, which results in the formation of small /3-phase particles; 
these are indicated in the microstructure inset at point g. With continued cooling, 
these particles will grow in size because the mass fraction of the /3 phase increases 
slightly with decreasing temperature. 

The third case involves solidification of the eutectic composition, 61.9 wt% Sn 
(C 3 in Figure 9.13). Consider an alloy having this composition that is cooled from a 
temperature within the liquid-phase region (e.g., 250°C) down the vertical line yy' in 
Figure 9.13. As the temperature is lowered, no changes occur until we reach the eutectic

temperature, 183°C. Upon crossing the eutectic isotherm, the liquid transforms to the 
two a and /3 phases. This transformation may be represented by the reaction 

cooling

heating 

in which the a- and /3-phase compositions are dictated by the eutectic isotherm end 
points. 

During this transformation, there must necessarily be a redistribution of the lead 
and tin components, inasmuch as the a and /3 phases have different compositions 
neither of which is the same as that of the liquid (as indicated in Equation 9.9). This 
redistribution is accomplished by atomic diffusion. The microstructure of the solid 
that results from this transformation consists of alternating layers (sometimes called 
lamellae) of the a and /3 phases that form simultaneously during the transformation. 
This microstructure, represented schematically in Figure 9.13, point /, is called a 
eutectic structure eutectic structure and is characteristic of this reaction. A photomicrograph of this 
structure for the lead-tin eutectic is shown in Figure 9.14. Subsequent cooling of the

layers). 375 X. (Reproduced with

alloy from just below the eutectic to room temperature will result in only minor mi- 
crostructural alterations. 

The microstructural change that accompanies this eutectic transformation is 
represented schematically in Figure 9.15; here is shown the a-/5 layered eutectic 
growing into and replacing the liquid phase. The process of the redistribution of 
lead and tin occurs by diffusion in the liquid just ahead of the eutectic-liquid in¬ 
terface. The arrows indicate the directions of diffusion of lead and tin atoms; lead 
atoms diffuse toward the a-phase layers because this a phase is lead-rich (18.3 wt% 
Sn-81.7 wt% Pb); conversely, the direction of diffusion of tin is in the direction of 
the /3, tin-rich (97.8 wt% Sn-2.2 wt% Pb) layers. The eutectic structure forms in 
these alternating layers because, for this lamellar configuration, atomic diffusion of 
lead and tin need only occur over relatively short distances. 

The fourth and final microstructural case for this system includes all composi¬ 
tions other than the eutectic that, when cooled, cross the eutectic isotherm. Consider, 
for example, the composition C 4 , Figure 9.16, which lies to the left of the eutectic; 
as the temperature is lowered, we move down the line zz\ beginning at point j. The 
microstructural development between points j and / is similar to that for the sec¬ 
ond case, such that just prior to crossing the eutectic isotherm (point /), the a and 
liquid phases are present having compositions of approximately 18.3 and 61.9 wt% 
Sn, respectively, as determined from the appropriate tie line. As the temperature is 
lowered to just below the eutectic, the liquid phase, which is of the eutectic com¬ 
position, will transform to the eutectic structure (i.e., alternating a and /3 lamellae); 
insignificant changes will occur with the a phase that formed during cooling through 
the a + L region. This microstructure is represented schematically by the inset at 
point m in Figure 9.16. Thus, the a phase will be present both in the eutectic struc¬ 
ture and also as the phase that formed while cooling through the a + L phase field. 
To distinguish one a from the other, that which resides in the eutectic structure is 
called eutectic a , while the other that formed prior to crossing the eutectic isotherm 
is termed primary a ; both are labeled in Figure 9.16. The photomicrograph in 
Figure 9.17 is of a lead-tin alloy in which both primary a and eutectic structures 
are shown. 

In dealing with microstructures, it is sometimes convenient to use the term 
microconstituent— that is, an element of the microstructure having an identifiable 


microconstituent

and characteristic structure. For example, in the point m inset, Figure 9.16, there are 
two microconstituents—namely, primary a and the eutectic structure. Thus, the eu¬ 
tectic structure is a microconstituent even though it is a mixture of two phases, be¬ 
cause it has a distinct lamellar structure, with a fixed ratio of the two phases. 

It is possible to compute the relative amounts of both eutectic and primary a 
microconstituents. Because the eutectic microconstituent always forms from the

liquid having the eutectic composition, this microconstituent may be assumed to 
have a composition of 61.9 wt% Sn. Hence, the lever rule is applied using a tie line 
between the a-(a + /3) phase boundary (18.3 wt% Sn) and the eutectic composi¬ 
tion. For example, consider the alloy of composition C\ in Figure 9.18. The fraction 
of the eutectic microconstituent W e is just the same as the fraction of liquid W L 
from which it transforms, or

The fractions of total a, W a (both eutectic and primary), and also of total 13, W p , 
are determined by use of the lever rule and a tie line that extends entirely across 
the a + f3 phase field. Again, for an alloy having composition C\,

Analogous transformations and microstructures result for alloys having com¬ 
positions to the right of the eutectic (i.e., between 61.9 and 97.8 wt% Sn). However, 
below the eutectic temperature, the microstructure will consist of the eutectic and 
primary /3 microconstituents because, upon cooling from the liquid, we pass through 
the /3 + liquid phase field. 

When, for case 4 (represented in Figure 9.16), conditions of equilibrium are 
not maintained while passing through the a (or f3) + liquid phase region, the fol¬ 
lowing consequences will be realized for the microstructure upon crossing the 
eutectic isotherm: (1) grains of the primary microconstituent will be cored, that 
is, have a nonuniform distribution of solute across the grains; and (2) the frac¬ 
tion of the eutectic microconstituent formed will be greater than for the equi¬ 
librium situation.

The isomorphous and eutectic phase diagrams discussed thus far are relatively 
simple, but those for many binary alloy systems are much more complex. The eu¬ 
tectic copper-silver and lead-tin phase diagrams (Figures 9.7 and 9.8) have only 
two solid phases, a and (3 ; these are sometimes termed terminal solid solutions, 
because they exist over composition ranges near the concentration extremities 
of the phase diagram. For other alloy systems, intermediate solid solutions (or 
intermediate phases ) may be found at other than the two composition extremes. 
Such is the case for the copper-zinc system. Its phase diagram (Figure 9.19) may 
at first appear formidable because there are some invariant points and reactions 
similar to the eutectic that have not yet been discussed. In addition, there are six 
different solid solutions—two terminal (a and iq) and four intermediate (/3, y, 8 , 
and e). (The f3 ', phase is termed an ordered solid solution, one in which the cop¬ 
per and zinc atoms are situated in a specific and ordered arrangement within 
each unit cell.) Some phase boundary lines near the bottom of Figure 9.19 are 
dashed to indicate that their positions have not been exactly determined. The 
reason for this is that at low temperatures, diffusion rates are very slow and in¬ 
ordinately long times are required to attain equilibrium. Again, only single- and 
two-phase regions are found on the diagram, and the same rules outlined in Sec¬ 
tion 9.8 are used to compute phase compositions and relative amounts. The com¬ 
mercial brasses are copper-rich copper-zinc alloys; for example, cartridge brass 
has a composition of 70 wt% Cu-30 wt% Zn and a microstructure consisting of 
a single a phase. 

For some systems, discrete intermediate compounds rather than solid solutions 
may be found on the phase diagram, and these compounds have distinct chemical 
formulas; for metal-metal systems, they are called intermetallic compounds. For ex¬ 
ample, consider the magnesium-lead system (Figure 9.20). The compound Mg 2 Pb

has a composition of 19 wt% Mg-81 wt% Pb (33 at% Pb), and is represented as a 
vertical line on the diagram, rather than as a phase region of finite width; hence, 
Mg 2 Pb can exist by itself only at this precise composition. 

Several other characteristics are worth noting for this magnesium-lead sys¬ 
tem. First, the compound Mg 2 Pb melts at approximately 550°C (1020°F), as indi¬ 
cated by point M in Figure 9.20. Also, the solubility of lead in magnesium is rather 
extensive, as indicated by the relatively large composition span for the a-phase 
field. On the other hand, the solubility of magnesium in lead is extremely lim¬ 
ited. This is evident from the very narrow (5 terminal solid-solution region on the 
right or lead-rich side of the diagram. Finally, this phase diagram may be thought 
of as two simple eutectic diagrams joined back to back, one for the Mg-Mg 2 Pb 
system and the other for Mg 2 Pb-Pb; as such, the compound Mg 2 Pb is really con¬ 
sidered to be a component. This separation of complex phase diagrams into 
smaller-component units may simplify them and, furthermore, expedite their 
interpretation. 


9.14 EUTECTOID AND PERITECTIC REACTIONS 

In addition to the eutectic, other invariant points involving three different phases 
are found for some alloy systems. One of these occurs for the copper-zinc sys¬ 
tem (Figure 9.19) at 560°C (1040°F) and 74 wt% Zn-26 wt% Cu. A portion of

The reverse reaction occurs upon heating. It is called a eutectoid (or eutectic-like) 

eutectoid reaction reaction, and the invariant point (point E , Figure 9.21) and the horizontal tie line 
at 560°C are termed the eutectoid and eutectoid isotherm, respectively. The feature 
distinguishing “eutectoid” from “eutectic” is that one solid phase instead of a liq¬ 
uid transforms into two other solid phases at a single temperature. A eutectoid re¬ 
action is found in the iron-carbon system (Section 9.18) that is very important in 
the heat treating of steels. 

peritectic reaction The peritectic reaction is yet another invariant reaction involving three phases 

at equilibrium. With this reaction, upon heating, one solid phase transforms into a 
liquid phase and another solid phase. A peritectic exists for the copper-zinc system 
(Figure 9.21, point P ) at 598°C (1108°F) and 78.6 wt% Zn-21.4 wt% Cu; this reac¬ 
tion is as follows:

wherein the 77 phase, when heated, transforms to e and liquid phases. Three other 
peritectics are found for the Cu-Zn system, the reactions of which involve 
/3, 8 , and y intermediate solid solutions as the low-temperature phases that trans¬ 
form upon heating.

9.15 CONGRUENT PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS 

Phase transformations may be classified according to whether there is any change 
in composition for the phases involved. Those for which there are no compositional 
congruent alterations are said to be congruent transformations. Conversely, for incongruent 

transformation transformations, at least one of the phases will experience a change in composition. 

Examples of congruent transformations include allotropic transformations (Section 
3.6) and melting of pure materials. Eutectic and eutectoid reactions, as well as the 
melting of an alloy that belongs to an isomorphous system, all represent incongru¬ 
ent transformations. 

Intermediate phases are sometimes classified on the basis of whether they melt 
congruently or incongruently. The intermetallic compound Mg 2 Pb melts congruently 
at the point designated M on the magnesium-lead phase diagram, Figure 9.20. Also, 
for the nickel-titanium system, Figure 9.22, there is a congruent melting point for 
the y solid solution that corresponds to the point of tangency for the pairs of liq- 
uidus and solidus lines, at 1310°C and 44.9 wt% Ti. Furthermore, the peritectic re¬ 
action is an example of incongruent melting for an intermediate phase.

9.16 CERAMIC AND TERNARY PHASE DIAGRAMS 

It need not be assumed that phase diagrams exist only for metal-metal systems; in 
fact, phase diagrams that are very useful in the design and processing of ceramic 
systems have been experimentally determined for quite a number of these materials. 
Ceramic phase diagrams are discussed in Section 12.7. 

Phase diagrams have also been determined for metallic (as well as ceramic) sys¬ 
tems containing more than two components; however, their representation and in¬ 
terpretation may be exceedingly complex. For example, a ternary, or three-component, 
composition-temperature phase diagram in its entirety is depicted by a three- 
dimensional model. Portrayal of features of the diagram or model in two dimen¬ 
sions is possible but somewhat difficult. 


9.17 THE GIBBS PHASE RULE 

The construction of phase diagrams as well as some of the principles governing the 
conditions for phase equilibria are dictated by laws of thermodynamics. One of these 
Gibbs phase rule is the Gibbs phase rule, proposed by the nineteenth-century physicist J. Willard 
Gibbs. This rule represents a criterion for the number of phases that will coexist 
within a system at equilibrium, and is expressed by the simple equation 


General form of the 
Gibbs phase rule 


P + F = C + N 


(9.16) 


where P is the number of phases present (the phase concept is discussed in Section 9.3). 
The parameter F is termed the number of degrees of freedom or the number of ex¬ 
ternally controlled variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition) which must 
be specified to completely define the state of the system. Expressed another way, 































9.17 The Gibbs Phase Rule *317 


F is the number of these variables that can be changed independently without 
altering the number of phases that coexist at equilibrium. The parameter C in Equa¬ 
tion 9.16 represents the number of components in the system. Components are nor¬ 
mally elements or stable compounds and, in the case of phase diagrams, are the 
materials at the two extremities of the horizontal compositional axis (e.g., H 2 0 and 
Ci 2 H 22 O n , and Cu and Ni for the phase diagrams shown in Figures 9.1 and 9.3a, re¬ 
spectively). Finally, N in Equation 9.16 is the number of noncompositional variables 
(e.g., temperature and pressure). 

Let us demonstrate the phase rule by applying it to binary temperature- 
composition phase diagrams, specifically the copper-silver system, Figure 9.7. Be¬ 
cause pressure is constant (1 atm), the parameter N is 1—temperature is the only 
noncompositional variable. Equation 9.16 now takes the form 

P + p = C + 1 (9.17) 

Furthermore, the number of components C is 2 (Cu and Ag), and 

P + F = 2+1 = 3 
or 

F = 3 — P 

Consider the case of single-phase fields on the phase diagram (e.g., a , /3, and 
liquid regions). Because only one phase is present, P = 1 and 

F= 3 - P 
=3-1=2 

This means that to completely describe the characteristics of any alloy that exists 
within one of these phase fields, we must specify two parameters; these are com¬ 
position and temperature, which locate, respectively, the horizontal and vertical 
positions of the alloy on the phase diagram. 

For the situation wherein two phases coexist, for example, a + L, /3 + L, and 
a + ft phase regions, Figure 9.7, the phase rule stipulates that we have but one de¬ 
gree of freedom because 

F= 3 - P 
=3-2=1 

Thus, it is necessary to specify either temperature or the composition of one of the 
phases to completely define the system. For example, suppose that we decide to 
specify temperature for the a + L phase region, say, 7\ in Figure 9.23. The com¬ 
positions of the a and liquid phases (C a and C L ) are thus dictated by the extremi¬ 
ties of the tie line constructed at T x across the a + L field. Note that only the nature 
of the phases is important in this treatment and not the relative phase amounts. 
This is to say that the overall alloy composition could lie anywhere along this tie 
line constructed at temperature 7\ and still give C a and C L compositions for the re¬ 
spective a and liquid phases. 

The second alternative is to stipulate the composition of one of the phases for 
this two-phase situation, which thereby fixes completely the state of the system. For 
example, if we specified C a as the composition of the a phase that is in equilibrium 
with the liquid (Figure 9.23), then both the temperature of the alloy (7\) and the 
composition of the liquid phase (C L ) are established, again by the tie line drawn 
across the a + L phase field so as to give this C a composition.

Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams

copper-rich section of the 
Cu-Ag phase diagram in 
which the Gibbs phase rule 
for the coexistence of two 
phases ( a and L) is 
demonstrated. Once the 
composition of either 
phase (C a or C L ) or the 
temperature (7\) is 
specified, values for the 
two remaining parameters 
are established by 
construction of the 
appropriate tie line. 


For binary systems, when three phases are present, there are no degrees of free¬ 
dom, because 


F = 3 - P 
=3-3=0 


This means that the compositions of all three phases as well as the temperature are 
fixed. This condition is met for a eutectic system by the eutectic isotherm; for the 
Cu-Ag system (Figure 9.7), it is the horizontal line that extends between points B 
and G. At this temperature, 779°C, the points at which each of the a , L, and (3 phase 
fields touch the isotherm line correspond to the respective phase compositions; 
namely, the composition of the a phase is fixed at 8.0 wt% Ag, that of the liquid at 
71.9 wt% Ag, and that of the /3 phase at 91.2 wt% Ag. Thus, three-phase equilib¬ 
rium will not be represented by a phase field, but rather by the unique horizontal 
isotherm line. Furthermore, all three phases will be in equilibrium for any alloy com¬ 
position that lies along the length of the eutectic isotherm (e.g., for the Cu-Ag 
system at 779°C and compositions between 8.0 and 91.2 wt% Ag). 

One use of the Gibbs phase rule is in analyzing for nonequilibrium conditions. 
For example, a microstructure for a binary alloy that developed over a range of 
temperatures and consisting of three phases is a nonequilibrium one; under these 
circumstances, three phases will exist only at a single temperature.

For a ternary system, three components are present; temperature is also a variable. 
What is the maximum number of phases that may be present for a ternary system,

9.18 The Iron-Iron Carbide (Fe-Fe 3 C) Phase Diagram * 319 


The Iron-Carbon System 

Of all binary alloy systems, the one that is possibly the most important is that 
for iron and carbon. Both steels and cast irons, primary structural materials in 
every technologically advanced culture, are essentially iron-carbon alloys. This 
section is devoted to a study of the phase diagram for this system and the de¬ 
velopment of several of the possible microstructures. The relationships among 
heat treatment, microstructure, and mechanical properties are explored in Chap¬ 
ters 10 and 11. 


9.18 THE IRON-IRON CARBIDE 
(Fe-Fe 3 C) PHASE DIAGRAM 

A portion of the iron-carbon phase diagram is presented in Figure 9.24. Pure iron, 
upon heating, experiences two changes in crystal structure before it melts. At room 
ferrite temperature the stable form, called ferrite, or a-iron, has a BCC crystal structure. 

Ferrite experiences a polymorphic transformation to FCC austenite, or y-iron, at 
912°C (1674°F). This austenite persists to 1394°C (2541°F), at which temperature 
the FCC austenite reverts back to a BCC phase known as 5-ferrite, which finally

melts at 1538°C (2800°F). All these changes are apparent along the left vertical axis 
of the phase diagram. 1 

The composition axis in Figure 9.24 extends only to 6.70 wt% C; at this concen¬ 
tration the intermediate compound iron carbide, or cementite (Fe 3 C), is formed, which 
is represented by a vertical line on the phase diagram. Thus, the iron-carbon system 
may be divided into two parts: an iron-rich portion, as in Figure 9.24, and the other 
(not shown) for compositions between 6.70 and 100 wt% C (pure graphite). In prac¬ 
tice, all steels and cast irons have carbon contents less than 6.70 wt% C; therefore, 
we consider only the iron-iron carbide system. Figure 9.24 would be more appropri¬ 
ately labeled the Fe-Fe 3 C phase diagram, because Fe 3 C is now considered to be a 
component. Convention and convenience dictate that composition still be expressed 
in “wt% C” rather than “wt% Fe 3 C”; 6.70 wt% C corresponds to 100 wt% Fe 3 C. 

Carbon is an interstitial impurity in iron and forms a solid solution with each 
of a- and 5-ferrites, and also with austenite, as indicated by the a , 5, and y single¬ 
phase fields in Figure 9.24. In the BCC a-ferrite, only small concentrations of 
carbon are soluble; the maximum solubility is 0.022 wt% at 727°C (1341°F). The 
limited solubility is explained by the shape and size of the BCC interstitial posi¬ 
tions, which make it difficult to accommodate the carbon atoms. Even though pres¬ 
ent in relatively low concentrations, carbon significantly influences the mechanical 
properties of ferrite. This particular iron-carbon phase is relatively soft, may be 
made magnetic at temperatures below 768°C (1414°F), and has a density of 7.88 
g/cm 3 . Figure 9.25a is a photomicrograph of a-ferrite. 

The austenite, or y phase of iron, when alloyed with carbon alone, is not stable 
below 727°C (1341°F), as indicated in Figure 9.24. The maximum solubility of 
carbon in austenite, 2.14 wt%, occurs at 1147°C (2097°F). This solubility is approx- 


1 The reader may wonder why no /3 phase is found on the Fe-Fe 3 C phase diagram, Figure 
9.24 (consistent with the a, /3, y, etc. labeling scheme described previously). Early investiga¬ 
tors observed that the ferromagnetic behavior of iron disappears at 768°C and attributed this 
phenomenon to a phase transformation; the “/3” label was assigned to the high-temperature 
phase. Later it was discovered that this loss of magnetism did not result from a phase trans¬ 
formation (see Section 20.6) and, therefore, the presumed (3 phase did not exist. 





9.18 The Iron-Iron Carbide (Fe-Fe 3 C) Phase Diagram * 321 

imately 100 times greater than the maximum for BCC ferrite, because the FCC inter¬ 
stitial positions are larger (see the results of Problem 4.5), and, therefore, the strains 
imposed on the surrounding iron atoms are much lower. As the discussions that follow 
demonstrate, phase transformations involving austenite are very important in the 
heat treating of steels. In passing, it should be mentioned that austenite is non¬ 
magnetic. Figure 9.25 b shows a photomicrograph of this austenite phase. 2 

The 5-ferrite is virtually the same as a-ferrite, except for the range of temper¬ 
atures over which each exists. Because the 5-ferrite is stable only at relatively high 
temperatures, it is of no technological importance and is not discussed further. 

Cementite (Fe 3 C) forms when the solubility limit of carbon in a-ferrite is ex¬ 
ceeded below 727°C (1341°F) (for compositions within the a + Fe 3 C phase region). 
As indicated in Figure 9.24, Fe 3 C will also coexist with the y phase between 727 
and 1147°C (1341 and 2097°F). Mechanically, cementite is very hard and brittle; the 
strength of some steels is greatly enhanced by its presence. 

Strictly speaking, cementite is only metastable; that is, it will remain as a com¬ 
pound indefinitely at room temperature. However, if heated to between 650 and 700°C 
(1200 and 1300°F) for several years, it will gradually change or transform into cr-iron 
and carbon, in the form of graphite, which will remain upon subsequent cooling to 
room temperature. Thus, the phase diagram in Figure 9.24 is not a true equilibrium 
one because cementite is not an equilibrium compound. However, inasmuch as the 
decomposition rate of cementite is extremely sluggish, virtually all the carbon in steel 
will be as Fe 3 C instead of graphite, and the iron-iron carbide phase diagram is, for 
all practical purposes, valid. As will be seen in Section 11.2, addition of silicon to cast 
irons greatly accelerates this cementite decomposition reaction to form graphite. 

The two-phase regions are labeled in Figure 9.24. It may be noted that one eu¬ 
tectic exists for the iron-iron carbide system, at 4.30 wt% C and 1147°C (2097°F);

the liquid solidifies to form austenite and cementite phases. Of course, subsequent 
cooling to room temperature will promote additional phase changes. 

It may be noted that a eutectoid invariant point exists at a composition of 0.76 wt% 
C and a temperature of 727°C (1341°F).This eutectoid reaction may be represented by

or, upon cooling, the solid y phase is transformed into a-iron and cementite. 
(Eutectoid phase transformations were addressed in Section 9.14.) The eutectoid 
phase changes described by Equation 9.19 are very important, being fundamental 
to the heat treatment of steels, as explained in subsequent discussions. 

Ferrous alloys are those in which iron is the prime component, but carbon as 
well as other alloying elements may be present. In the classification scheme of fer¬ 
rous alloys based on carbon content, there are three types: iron, steel, and cast iron. 
Commercially pure iron contains less than 0.008 wt% C and, from the phase dia¬ 
gram, is composed almost exclusively of the ferrite phase at room temperature. The 


2 Annealing twins, found in alloys having the FCC crystal structure (Section 4.6), may be 
observed in this photomicrograph for austenite. Such do not occur in BCC alloys, which 
explains their absence in the ferrite micrograph of Figure 9.25a. 







322 * Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams 


iron-carbon alloys that contain between 0.008 and 2.14 wt% C are classified as 
steels. In most steels the microstructure consists of both a and Fe 3 C phases. Upon 
cooling to room temperature, an alloy within this composition range must pass 
through at least a portion of the y-phase field; distinctive microstructures are sub¬ 
sequently produced, as discussed shortly. Although a steel alloy may contain as much 
as 2.14 wt% C, in practice, carbon concentrations rarely exceed 1.0 wt%. The prop¬ 
erties and various classifications of steels are treated in Section 11.2. Cast irons are 
classified as ferrous alloys that contain between 2.14 and 6.70 wt% C. However, 
commercial cast irons normally contain less than 4.5 wt% C. These alloys are dis¬ 
cussed further also in Section 11.2. 

9.19 DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRUCTURE IN 
IRON-CARBON ALLOYS 

Several of the various microstructures that may be produced in steel alloys and their 
relationships to the iron-iron carbon phase diagram are now discussed, and it is 
shown that the microstructure that develops depends on both the carbon content 
and heat treatment. This discussion is confined to very slow cooling of steel alloys, 
in which equilibrium is continuously maintained. A more detailed exploration of 
the influence of heat treatment on microstructure, and ultimately on the mechani¬ 
cal properties of steels, is contained in Chapter 10. 

Phase changes that occur upon passing from the y region into the a + Fe 3 C 
phase field (Figure 9.24) are relatively complex and similar to those described for 
the eutectic systems in Section 9.12. Consider, for example, an alloy of eutectoid 
composition (0.76 wt% C) as it is cooled from a temperature within the y phase re¬ 
gion, say, 800°C—that is, beginning at point a in Figure 9.26 and moving down the

composition (0.76 wt% C)

vertical line xx\ Initially, the alloy is composed entirely of the austenite phase hav¬ 
ing a composition of 0.76 wt% C and corresponding microstructure, also indicated 
in Figure 9.26. As the alloy is cooled, no changes will occur until the eutectoid tem¬ 
perature (727°C) is reached. Upon crossing this temperature to point b , the austen¬ 
ite transforms according to Equation 9.19. 

The microstructure for this eutectoid steel that is slowly cooled through the eu¬ 
tectoid temperature consists of alternating layers or lamellae of the two phases (a 
and Fe 3 C) that form simultaneously during the transformation. In this case, the rel¬ 
ative layer thickness is approximately 8 to 1. This microstructure, represented 
schematically in Figure 9.26, point b , is called pearlite because it has the appear¬ 
ance of mother-of-pearl when viewed under the microscope at low magnifications. 
Figure 9.27 is a photomicrograph of a eutectoid steel showing the pearlite. The 
pearlite exists as grains, often termed colonies; within each colony the layers are 
oriented in essentially the same direction, which varies from one colony to another. 
The thick light layers are the ferrite phase, and the cementite phase appears as thin 
lamellae most of which appear dark. Many cementite layers are so thin that adja¬ 
cent phase boundaries are so close together that they are indistinguishable at this 
magnification, and, therefore, appear dark. Mechanically, pearlite has properties in¬ 
termediate between the soft, ductile ferrite and the hard, brittle cementite. 

The alternating a and Fe 3 C layers in pearlite form as such for the same rea¬ 
son that the eutectic structure (Figures 9.13 and 9.14) forms—because the com¬ 
position of the parent phase [in this case austenite (0.76 wt% C)] is different 
from either of the product phases [ferrite (0.022 wt% C) and cementite (6.70 wt% 
C)], and the phase transformation requires that there be a redistribution of the 
carbon by diffusion. Figure 9.28 illustrates schematically microstructural changes 
that accompany this eutectoid reaction; here the directions of carbon diffusion 
are indicated by arrows. Carbon atoms diffuse away from the 0.022 wt% ferrite 
regions and to the 6.70 wt% cementite layers, as the pearlite extends from the 
grain boundary into the unreacted austenite grain. The layered pearlite forms be¬ 
cause carbon atoms need diffuse only minimal distances with the formation of 
this structure. 

Furthermore, subsequent cooling of the pearlite from point b in Figure 9.26 will 
produce relatively insignificant microstructural changes.

Hypoeutectoid Alloys 

Microstructures for iron-iron carbide alloys having other than the eutectoid com¬ 
position are now explored; these are analogous to the fourth case described in 
Section 9.12 and illustrated in Figure 9.16 for the eutectic system. Consider a com¬ 
position C 0 to the left of the eutectoid, between 0.022 and 0.76 wt% C; this is termed 
a hypoeutectoid (less than eutectoid) alloy. Cooling an alloy of this composition is 
represented by moving down the vertical line yy' in Figure 9.29. At about 875°C, 
point c, the microstructure will consist entirely of grains of the y phase, as shown

schematically in the figure. In cooling to point d, about 775°C, which is within the 
a + y phase region, both these phases will coexist as in the schematic microstruc¬ 
ture. Most of the small a particles will form along the original y grain boundaries. 
The compositions of both a and y phases may be determined using the appropriate 
tie line; these compositions correspond, respectively, to about 0.020 and 0.40 wt% C. 

While cooling an alloy through the a + y phase region, the composition of the 
ferrite phase changes with temperature along the a - (a + y) phase boundary, line 
MN , becoming slightly richer in carbon. On the other hand, the change in compo¬ 
sition of the austenite is more dramatic, proceeding along the (a + y) — y bound¬ 
ary, line MO , as the temperature is reduced. 

Cooling from point d to e, just above the eutectoid but still in the a + y region, 
will produce an increased fraction of the a phase and a microstructure similar to 
that also shown: the a particles will have grown larger. At this point, the composi¬ 
tions of the a and y phases are determined by constructing a tie line at the tem¬ 
perature T e \ the a phase will contain 0.022 wt% C, whereas the y phase will be of 
the eutectoid composition, 0.76 wt% C. 

As the temperature is lowered just below the eutectoid, to point /, all the y 
phase that was present at temperature T e (and having the eutectoid composition) 
will transform to pearlite, according to the reaction in Equation 9.19. There will be 
virtually no change in the a phase that existed at point e in crossing the eutectoid 
temperature—it will normally be present as a continuous matrix phase surround¬ 
ing the isolated pearlite colonies. The microstructure at point / will appear as the 
corresponding schematic inset of Figure 9.29. Thus the ferrite phase will be present 
both in the pearlite and also as the phase that formed while cooling through the 
a + y phase region. The ferrite that is present in the pearlite is called eutectoid 
ferrite, whereas the other, that formed above T e , is termed proeutectoid (meaning 
“pre- or before eutectoid”) ferrite, as labeled in Figure 9.29. Figure 9.30 is a pho¬ 
tomicrograph of a 0.38 wt% C steel; large, white regions correspond to the proeu¬ 
tectoid ferrite. For pearlite, the spacing between the a and Fe 3 C layers varies

from grain to grain; some of the pearlite appears dark because the many close¬ 
spaced layers are unresolved at the magnification of the photomicrograph. Note 
that two microconstituents are present in this micrograph—proeutectoid ferrite and 
pearlite—which will appear in all hypoeutectoid iron-carbon alloys that are slowly 
cooled to a temperature below the eutectoid. 

The relative amounts of the proeutectoid a and pearlite may be determined in 
a manner similar to that described in Section 9.12 for primary and eutectic micro¬ 
constituents. We use the lever rule in conjunction with a tie line that extends from 
the a - (a + Fe 3 C) phase boundary (0.022 wt% C) to the eutectoid composition 
(0.76 wt% C), inasmuch as pearlite is the transformation product of austenite having 
this composition. For example, let us consider an alloy of composition Cq in Fig¬ 
ure 9.31. Thus, the fraction of pearlite, W p , may be determined according to 

T

Of course, fractions of both total a (eutectoid and proeutectoid) and cementite are 
determined using the lever rule and a tie line that extends across the entirety of the 
a + Fe 3 C phase region, from 0.022 to 6.70 wt% C.

Hypereutectoid Alloys 

Analogous transformations and microstructures result for hypereutectoid alloys, 
those containing between 0.76 and 2.14 wt% C, which are cooled from tempera¬ 
tures within the y phase field. Consider an alloy of composition C x in Figure 9.32 
that, upon cooling, moves down the line zz'. At point g only the y phase will be 
present with a composition of C 3 ; the microstructure will appear as shown, having 
only y grains. Upon cooling into the y + Fe 3 C phase field—say, to point h —the ce¬ 
mentite phase will begin to form along the initial y grain boundaries, similar to the 
a phase in Figure 9.29, point d. This cementite is called proeutectoid cementite— 
that which forms before the eutectoid reaction. Of course, the cementite composi¬ 
tion remains constant (6.70 wt% C) as the temperature changes. However, the com¬ 
position of the austenite phase will move along line PO toward the eutectoid. As 
the temperature is lowered through the eutectoid to point /, all remaining austen¬ 
ite of eutectoid composition is converted into pearlite; thus, the resulting mi¬ 
crostructure consists of pearlite and proeutectoid cementite as microconstituents 
(Figure 9.32). In the photomicrograph of a 1.4 wt% C steel (Figure 9.33), note that 
the proeutectoid cementite appears light. Because it has much the same appear¬ 
ance as proeutectoid ferrite (Figure 9.30), there is some difficulty in distinguishing 
between hypoeutectoid and hypereutectoid steels on the basis of microstructure. 

Relative amounts of both pearlite and proeutectoid Fe 3 C microconstituents may 
be computed for hypereutectoid steel alloys in a manner analogous to that for 
hypoeutectoid materials; the appropriate tie line extends between 0.76 and 6.70

Solution 

(a) This part of the problem is solved by application of the lever rule expres¬ 
sions employing a tie line that extends all the way across the a + Fe 3 C phase 
field. Thus, C' 0 is 0.35 wt% C, and

(i.e.. Equations 9.20 and 9.21). Or

(c) All ferrite is either as proeutectoid or eutectoid (in the pearlite). There¬ 
fore, the sum of these two ferrite fractions will equal the fraction of total fer¬ 
rite; that is, 


W , + W = W

where W ae denotes the fraction of the total alloy that is eutectoid ferrite. Val¬ 
ues for W a and W a > were determined in parts (a) and (b) as 0.95 and 0.56, 
respectively. Therefore, 

W ae = W a — W a > = 0.95 - 0.56 = 0.39 


Nonequilibrium Cooling 

In this discussion on the microstructural development of iron-carbon alloys it has 
been assumed that, upon cooling, conditions of metastable equilibrium 3 have been 
continuously maintained; that is, sufficient time has been allowed at each new tem¬ 
perature for any necessary adjustment in phase compositions and relative amounts 
as predicted from the Fe-Fe 3 C phase diagram. In most situations these cooling rates 
are impractically slow and really unnecessary; in fact, on many occasions nonequi¬ 
librium conditions are desirable. Two nonequilibrium effects of practical importance 
are (1) the occurrence of phase changes or transformations at temperatures other 
than those predicted by phase boundary lines on the phase diagram, and (2) the 


3 The term metastable equilibrium is used in this discussion inasmuch as Fe 3 C is only a 
metastable compound.

phase diagram. Both are discussed in the next chapter. 


9.20 THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER ALLOYING 
ELEMENTS 

Additions of other alloying elements (Cr, Ni,Ti, etc.) bring about rather dramatic 
changes in the binary iron-iron carbide phase diagram, Figure 9.24. The extent 
of these alterations of the positions of phase boundaries and the shapes of the 
phase fields depends on the particular alloying element and its concentration. 
One of the important changes is the shift in position of the eutectoid with re¬ 
spect to temperature and to carbon concentration. These effects are illustrated 
in Figures 9.34 and 9.35, which plot the eutectoid temperature and eutectoid 
composition (in wt% C) as a function of concentration for several other alloy¬ 
ing elements. Thus, other alloy additions alter not only the temperature of the 
eutectoid reaction but also the relative fractions of pearlite and the proeutectoid 
phase that form. Steels are normally alloyed for other reasons, however —usually 
either to improve their corrosion resistance or to render them amenable to heat 
treatment (see Section 11.8).

Summary • 331 


SUMMARY 


Introduction 

• Equilibrium phase diagrams are a convenient and concise way of representing 
the most stable relationships between phases in alloy systems. 

Phases 

• A phase is some portion of a body of material throughout which the physical and 
chemical characteristics are homogeneous. 

Microstructure 

• Three microstructural characteristics that are important for multiphase alloys are 

The number of phases present 

The relative proportions of the phases 

The manner in which the phases are arranged 

• Three factors affect the microstructure of an alloy: 

What alloying elements are present 

The concentrations of these alloying elements 

The heat treatment of the alloy 

Phase Equilibria 

• A system at equilibrium is in its most stable state—that is, its phase characteristics 
do not change over time. Thermodynamically, the condition for phase equilibrium 
is that the free energy of a system is a minimum for some set combination of 
temperature, pressure, and composition. 

• Metastable systems are nonequilibrium ones that persist indefinitely and experi¬ 
ence imperceptible changes with time. 

One-Component (or Unary) Phase Diagrams 

• For one-component phase diagrams logarithm of pressure is plotted versus tem¬ 
perature; solid-, liquid-, and vapor-phase regions are found on this type of diagram. 

Binary Phase Diagrams 

• For binary systems, temperature and composition are variables, whereas external 
pressure is held constant. Areas, or phase regions, are defined on these temperature- 
versus-composition plots within which either one or two phases exist. 

Binary Isomorphous Systems 

• Isomorphous diagrams are those for which there is complete solubility in the solid 
phase; the copper-nickel system (Figure 9.3a) displays this behavior. 

Interpretation of Phase Diagrams 

• For an alloy of specified composition, at a known temperature, and that is at equi¬ 
librium, the following may be determined: 

What phase(s) is (are) present —from the location of the temperature- 
composition point on the phase diagram. 

Phase composition(s)—for the two-phase situation a horizontal tie line is 
employed. 

Phase mass fraction(s)—the lever rule [which utilizes tie line segment lengths 
(Equations 9.1 and 9.2)] is used in two-phase regions. 



332 


Chapter 9 / Phase Diagrams 


Binary Eutectic Systems 

• In a eutectic reaction, as found in some alloy systems, a liquid phase transforms 
isothermally to two different solid phases upon cooling (i.e., L —» a + (3). Such a 
reaction is noted on the copper-silver and lead-tin phase diagrams (Figures 9.7 
and 9.8, respectively). 

• The solubility limit at some temperature corresponds to the maximum concen¬ 
tration of one component that will go into solution in a specific phase. For a 
binary eutectic system, solubility limits are to be found along solidus and solvus 
phase boundaries. 

Development of Microstructure in Eutectic Alloys 

• The solidification of an alloy (liquid) of eutectic composition yields a mi¬ 
crostructure consisting of layers of the two solid phases that alternate. 

• A primary (or pre-eutectic) phase as well as the layered eutectic structure will 
be the solidification products for all compositions (other than the eutectic) that 
lie along the eutectic isotherm. 

• Mass fractions of the primary phase and eutectic microconstituent may be com¬ 
puted using the lever rule and a tie line that extends to the eutectic composition 
(e.g., Equations 9.10 and 9.11). 

Equilibrium Diagrams Having Intermediate Phases or Compounds 

• Other equilibrium diagrams are more complex in that they may have phases/solid 
solutions/compounds that do not lie at the concentration (i.e., horizontal) ex¬ 
tremities on the diagram. These include intermediate solid solutions and inter- 
metallic compounds. 

• In addition to the eutectic, other reactions involving three phases may occur at 
invariant points on a phase diagram: 

For a eutectoid reaction, upon cooling, one solid phase transforms into two 
other solid phases (e.g., a —> (5 + y). 

For a peritectic reaction, upon cooling, a liquid and one solid phase trans¬ 
form to another solid phase (e.g., L + a —» fS). 

• A transformation wherein there is no change in composition for the phases 
involved is congruent. 

The Gibbs Phase Rule 

• The Gibbs phase rule is a simple equation (Equation 9.16 in its most general 
form) that relates the number of phases present in a system at equilibrium with 
the number of degrees of freedom, the number of components, and the number 
of noncompositional variables. 

The Iron-Iron Carbide (Fe-Fe 3 C) Phase Diagram 

• Important phases found on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram (Figure 9.24) are 
a-ferrite (BCC), y-austenite (FCC), and the intermetallic compound iron carbide 
[or cementite (Fe 3 C)]. 

• On the basis of composition, ferrous alloys fall into three classifications: 

Irons (<0.008 wt% C) 

Steels (0.008 wt% C to 2.14 wt% C) 

Cast irons (>2.14 wt% C) 


Summary * 333 


Development of Microstructure in Iron-Carbon Alloys 

• The development of microstructure for many iron-carbon alloys and steels depends 
on a eutectoid reaction in which the austenite phase of composition 0.76 wt% C 
transforms isothermally (at 727°C) to cr-ferrite (0.022 wt% C) and cementite 
(i.e., y —> a + Fe 3 C). 

• The microstructural product of an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition is 
pearlite, a microconstituent consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite. 

• The microstructures of alloys having carbon contents less than the eutectoid (i.e., 
hypoeutectoid alloys) are composed of a proeutectoid ferrite phase in addition 
to pearlite. 

• Pearlite and proeutectoid cementite constitute the microconstituents for 
hypereutectoid alloys—those with carbon contents in excess of the eutectoid 
composition. 

• Mass fractions of a proeutectoid phase (ferrite or cementite) and pearlite may 
be computed using the lever rule and a tie line that extends to the eutectoid com¬ 
position (0.76 wt% C) [e.g., Equations 9.20 and 9.21 (for hypoeutectoid alloys) 
and Equations 9.22 and 9.23 (for hypereutectoid alloys)].

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

For iron-carbon alloys (i.e., steels), an understanding of microstructures that de¬ 
velop during relatively slow rates of cooling (i.e., pearlite and a proeutectoid phase) 
is facilitated by the iron-iron carbide phase diagram. Other concepts in this chap¬ 
ter were presented as a prelude to the introduction of this diagram—the concepts 
of a phase, phase equilibrium, metastability, and the eutectoid reaction. In Chapter 
10 we explore yet other microstructures that form when iron-carbon alloys are 
cooled from elevated temperatures at more rapid rates. These concepts are sum¬ 
marized in the following diagram:

C h a pt e, 10 Phase Transformations: 

Development of Microstructure and Alteration of Mechanical Properties 



I wo pressure-temperature phase diagrams are shown: for H z O (top) and C0 2 (bottom). 
Phase transformations occur, when phase boundaries (the red curves) on these plots are 
crossed as temperature and/or pressure is changed. For example, ice melts (transforms to 
liquid water) upon heating, which corresponds to crossing the solid-liquid phase boundary, 

as represented by the arrow on the H 2 0 phase 
diagram. Similarly, upon passing across the solid-gas 
phase boundary of the C0 2 phase diagram, dry ice 
(solid C0 2 ) sublimes (transforms to gaseous C0 2 ). 
Again, an arrow delineates this phase transformation.

WHY STUDY Phase Transformations ? 


The development of a set of desirable mechanical 
characteristics for a material often results from a phase 
transformation that is wrought by a heat treatment. 
The time and temperature dependencies of some 
phase transformations are conveniently represented on 
modified phase diagrams. It is important to know how 
to use these diagrams in order to design a heat 
treatment for some alloy that will yield the desired 
room-temperature mechanical properties. For 
example, the tensile strength of an iron-carbon alloy 
of eutectoid composition (0.76 wt% C) can be varied 
between approximately 700 MPa (100,000 psi) and 
2000 MPa (300,000 psi) depending on the heat 
treatment employed. 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying phase transformations are 
as follows: 


• Heat treatments for metal alloys (as well as other 
materials) are designed on the basis of how 
temperature influences the rate at which phase 
transformations occur. In this chapter we explore 
the concept of transformation rate as well as its 
dependence on temperature. 

• For iron-carbon alloys, the development of 
rmcrostructural elements other than pearlite (and 

a proeutectoid phase, as discussed in Chapter 9) are 
possible. These microstructures, their mechanical 
properties, and their structure-property correlations 
are given. Furthermore, discussions are provided 
that describe heat treatments that produce each of 
the microstructures. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do 

1. Make a schematic fraction transformation- 
versus-logarithm of time plot for a typical 
solid-solid transformation; cite the equation 
that describes this behavior. 

2. Briefly describe the microstructure for each of the 
following microconstituents that are found in steel 
alloys: fine pearlite, coarse pearlite, spheroidite, 
bainite, martensite, and tempered martensite. 

3. Cite the general mechanical characteristics for 
each of the following microconstituents: fine 


the following: 

pearlite, coarse pearlite, spheroidite, bainite, 
martensite, and tempered martensite. Now, in 
terms of microstructure (or crystal structure), 
briefly explain these behaviors. 

4. Given the isothermal transformation (or contin¬

10.1 INTRODUCTION 

One reason metallic materials are so versatile is that their mechanical properties 
(strength, hardness, ductility, etc.) are subject to control and management over rela¬ 
tively large ranges. Three strengthening mechanisms were discussed in Chapter 7— 
namely grain size refinement, solid-solution strengthening, and strain hardening. 
Additional techniques are available wherein the mechanical behavior of a metal 
alloy is influenced by its microstructure. 

The development of microstructure in both single- and two-phase alloys ordi¬ 
narily involves some type of phase transformation—an alteration in the number 
and/or character of the phases. The first portion of this chapter is devoted to a brief 
discussion of some of the basic principles relating to transformations involving solid 
phases. Inasmuch as most phase transformations do not occur instantaneously, 
consideration is given to the dependence of reaction progress on time, or the trans- 
transformation rate formation rate. This is followed by a discussion of the development of two-phase

microstructures for iron-carbon alloys. Modified phase diagrams are introduced that 
permit determination of the microstructure that results from a specific heat treat¬ 
ment. Finally, other microconstituents in addition to pearlite are presented, and, for 
each, the mechanical properties are discussed. 

Phase Transformations 

10.2 BASIC CONCEPTS 

phase transformation A variety of phase transformations are important in the processing of materials, 
and usually they involve some alteration of the microstructure. For purposes of this 
discussion, these transformations are divided into three classifications. In one group 
are simple diffusion-dependent transformations in which there is no change in ei¬ 
ther the number or composition of the phases present. These include solidification 
of a pure metal, allotropic transformations, and recrystallization and grain growth 
(see Sections 7.12 and 7.13). 

In another type of diffusion-dependent transformation, there is some alteration 
in phase compositions and often in the number of phases present; the final mi¬ 
crostructure ordinarily consists of two phases. The eutectoid reaction, described by 
Equation 9.19, is of this type; it receives further attention in Section 10.5. 

The third kind of transformation is diffusionless, wherein a metastable phase is 
produced. As discussed in Section 10.5, a martensitic transformation, which may be 
induced in some steel alloys, falls into this category. 

10.3 THE KINETICS OF PHASE 
TRANSFORMATIONS 

With phase transformations, normally at least one new phase is formed that has 
different physical/chemical characteristics and/or a different structure than the 
parent phase. Furthermore, most phase transformations do not occur instanta¬ 
neously. Rather, they begin by the formation of numerous small particles of the 
new phase(s), which increase in size until the transformation has reached com¬ 
pletion. The progress of a phase transformation may be broken down into two 

nucleation, growth distinct stages: nucleation and growth. Nucleation involves the appearance of very 
small particles, or nuclei of the new phase (often consisting of only a few hundred 
atoms), which are capable of growing. During the growth stage these nuclei in¬ 
crease in size, which results in the disappearance of some (or all) of the parent 
phase. The transformation reaches completion if the growth of these new phase 
particles is allowed to proceed until the equilibrium fraction is attained. We now 
discuss the mechanics of these two processes and how they relate to solid-state 
transformations. 

Nucleation 

There are two types of nucleation: homogeneous and heterogeneous. The distinction 
between them is made according to the site at which nucleating events occur. For 
the homogeneous type, nuclei of the new phase form uniformly throughout the 
parent phase, whereas for the heterogeneous type, nuclei form preferentially at 
structural inhomogeneities, such as container surfaces, insoluble impurities, grain 
boundaries, dislocations, and so on. We begin by discussing homogeneous nucle¬ 
ation because its description and theory are simpler to treat. These principles are 
then extended to a discussion of the heterogeneous type.

Homogeneous Nucleation 

A discussion of the theory of nucleation involves a thermodynamic parameter called 
free energy (or Gibbs free energy ), G. In brief, free energy is a function of other 
thermodynamic parameters, of which one is the internal energy of the system (i.e., 
the enthalpy , H ), and another is a measurement of the randomness or disorder of 
the atoms or molecules (i.e., the entropy , S). It is not our purpose here to provide 
a detailed discussion of the principles of thermodynamics as they apply to materials 
systems. However, relative to phase transformations, an important thermodynamic 
parameter is the change in free energy AG; a transformation will occur sponta¬ 
neously only when AG has a negative value. 

For the sake of simplicity, let us first consider the solidification of a pure ma¬ 
terial, assuming that nuclei of the solid phase form in the interior of the liquid as 
atoms cluster together so as to form a packing arrangement similar to that found 
in the solid phase. Furthermore, it will be assumed that each nucleus is spherical 
and has a radius r. This situation is represented schematically in Figure 10.1. 

There are two contributions to the total free energy change that accompany a 
solidification transformation. The first is the free energy difference between the 
solid and liquid phases, or the volume free energy, A G v . Its value will be negative 
if the temperature is below the equilibrium solidification temperature, and the mag¬ 
nitude of its contribution is the product of A G v and the volume of the spherical 
nucleus (i.e., rr 3 ). The second energy contribution results from the formation of 
the solid-liquid phase boundary during the solidification transformation. Associ¬ 
ated with this boundary is a surface free energy, y, which is positive; furthermore, 
the magnitude of this contribution is the product of y and the surface area of the 
nucleus (i.e., 47rr 2 ). Finally, the total free energy change is equal to the sum of these 
two contributions—that is, 


AG = ^7rr 3 AG v + 47rr 2 y (10.1) 

These volume, surface, and total free energy contributions are plotted schematically 
as a function of nucleus radius in Figures 10.2a and 10.2 b. Here (Figure 10.2a) it 
will be noted that for the curve corresponding to the first term on the right-hand 
side of Equation 10.1, the free energy (which is negative) decreases with the third 
power of r. Furthermore, for the curve resulting from the second term in Equation 
10.1, energy values are positive and increase with the square of the radius. Conse¬ 
quently, the curve associated with the sum of both terms (Figure 10.2 b) first in¬ 
creases, passes through a maximum, and finally decreases. In a physical sense, this 
means that as a solid particle begins to form as atoms in the liquid cluster together, 
its free energy first increases. If this cluster reaches a size corresponding to the

critical radius r*, then growth will continue with the accompaniment of a decrease 
in free energy. On the other hand, a cluster of radius less than the critical will shrink 
and redissolve. This subcritical particle is an embryo, whereas the particle of radius 
greater than r* is termed a nucleus. A critical free energy, AG*, occurs at the criti¬ 
cal radius and, consequently, at the maximum of the curve in Figure 10.2&.This AG* 
corresponds to an activation free energy, which is the free energy required for the 
formation of a stable nucleus. Equivalently, it may be considered an energy barrier 
to the nucleation process. 

Because r* and AG* appear at the maximum on the free energy-versus- 
radius curve of Figure 10.2Z>, derivation of expressions for these two parameters is 
a simple matter. For r*, we differentiate the AG equation (Equation 10.1) with re¬ 
spect to r, set the resulting expression equal to zero, and then solve for r (= r*). 
That is, 

d(AG) A

which leads to the result 


r

Now, substitution of this expression for r* into Equation 10.1 yields the following 
expression for AG*: 


AG* =

(10.4) 


This volume free energy change AG, is the driving force for the solidification 
transformation, and its magnitude is a function of temperature. At the equilibrium 
solidification temperature T m , the value of AG, is zero, and with diminishing tem¬ 
perature its value becomes increasingly more negative.

(10.7) 


Thus, from these two equations, both the critical radius r* and the activation free 
energy AG* decrease as temperature T decreases. (The y and A H f parameters in 
these expressions are relatively insensitive to temperature changes.) Figure 10.3, a 
schematic AG-versus-r plot that shows curves for two different temperatures, illus¬ 
trates these relationships. Physically, this means that with a lowering of temperature 
at temperatures below the equilibrium solidification temperature (T m ), nucleation 
occurs more readily. Furthermore, the number of stable nuclei n * (having radii 
greater than r*) is a function of temperature as 

n* = K t exp( - -j^rj (10.8) 

where the constant K x is related to the total number of nuclei of the solid phase. 
For the exponential term of this expression, changes in temperature have a greater 
effect on the magnitude of the AG* term in the numerator than the T term in the 
denominator. Consequently, as the temperature is lowered below T m , the exponen¬ 
tial term in Equation 10.8 also decreases such that the magnitude of /r* increases. 
This temperature dependence (/?* versus T) is represented in the schematic plot of 
Figure 10.4a. 

Another important temperature-dependent step is involved in and also influences 
nucleation: the clustering of atoms by short-range diffusion during the formation of 
nuclei. The influence of temperature on the rate of diffusion (i.e., magnitude of the

diffusion coefficient, D ) is given in Equation 5.8. Furthermore, this diffusion ef¬ 
fect is related to the frequency at which atoms from the liquid attach themselves 
to the solid nucleus, v d . Or, the dependence of v d on temperature is the same as 
for the diffusion coefficient—namely, 

Vd = K 2 exp^ - (10.9) 

where Q d is a temperature-independent parameter—the activation energy for diffu¬ 
sion—and K 2 is a temperature-independent constant. Thus, from Equation 10.9 a 
diminishment of temperature results in a reduction in v d . This effect, represented by 
the curve shown in Figure 10 Ab, is just the reverse of that for n* as discussed earlier. 

The principles and concepts just developed are now extended to a discussion 
of another important nucleation parameter, the nucleation rate N (which has units 
of nuclei per unit volume per second). This rate is simply proportional to the prod¬ 
uct of w* (Equation 10.8) and v d (Equation 10.9); that is, 


N = K 3 n*v d = K X K 2 K 3 



AG* \

Here K 3 is the number of atoms on a nucleus surface. Figure 10.4c schematically 
plots nucleation rate as a function of temperature and, in addition, the curves of 
Figures 10Aa and 10Ab from which the N curve is derived. Note (Figure 10.4c) that, 
with a lowering of temperature from below T m , the nucleation rate first increases, 
achieves a maximum, and subsequently diminishes. 

The shape of this N curve is explained as follows: for the upper region of the 
curve (a sudden and dramatic increase in TV with decreasing T ), AG* is greater than 
Q d , which means that the exp(-A G*/kT) term of Equation 10.10 is much smaller 
than exp (~Q d /kT). In other words, the nucleation rate is suppressed at high tem¬ 
peratures because of a small activation driving force. With continued diminishment 
of temperature, there comes a point at which AG* becomes smaller than the 
temperature-independent Q d with the result that exp (—Q d lkT) < exp(-AG*//cT), or 
that, at lower temperatures, a low atomic mobility suppresses the nucleation rate. 
This accounts for the shape of the lower curve segment (a precipitous reduction of 
N with a continued diminishment of temperature). Furthermore, the N curve of Fig¬ 
ure 10.4c necessarily passes through a maximum over the intermediate tempera¬ 
ture range where values for AG* and Q d are of approximately the same magnitude.

Several qualifying comments are in order regarding the preceding discussion. 
First, although we assumed a spherical shape for nuclei, this method may be ap¬ 
plied to any shape with the same final result. Furthermore, this treatment may be 
utilized for types of transformations other than solidification (i.e., liquid-solid)—for 
example, solid-vapor and solid-solid. However, magnitudes of AG n ^nd y, in addi¬ 
tion to diffusion rates of the atomic species, will undoubtedly differ among the var¬ 
ious transformation types. In addition, for solid-solid transformations, there may be 
volume changes attendant to the formation of new phases. These changes may lead 
to the introduction of microscopic strains, which must be taken into account in the 
AG expression of Equation 10.1, and, consequently, will affect the magnitudes of r* 
and AG*. 

From Figure 10.4c it is apparent that during the cooling of a liquid, an appre¬ 
ciable nucleation rate (i.e., solidification) will begin only after the temperature has 
been lowered to below the equilibrium solidification (or melting) temperature ( T m ). 
This phenomenon is termed supercooling (or undercooling ), and the degree of su¬ 
percooling for homogeneous nucleation may be significant (on the order of several 
hundred degrees Kelvin) for some systems. Table 10.1 shows, for several materials, 
typical degrees of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.1 

Computation of Critical Nucleus Radius and 
Activation Free Energy 

(a) For the solidification of pure gold, calculate the critical radius r* and the 
activation free energy AG* if nucleation is homogeneous. Values for the la¬ 
tent heat of fusion and surface free energy are -1.16 X 10 9 J/m 3 and 0.132 
J/m 2 , respectively. Use the supercooling value found in Table 10.1. 

(b) Now calculate the number of atoms found in a nucleus of critical size. 
Assume a lattice parameter of 0.413 nm for solid gold at its melting 
temperature.

Solution 

(a) In order to compute the critical radius, we employ Equation 10.6, using 
the melting temperature of 1064°C for gold, assuming a supercooling value of 
230°C (Table 10.1), and realizing that A 11, is negative. Hence

(b) In order to compute the number of atoms in a nucleus of critical size (as¬ 
suming a spherical nucleus of radius r*), it is first necessary to determine the 
number of unit cells, which we then multiply by the number of atoms per unit 
cell. The number of unit cells found in this critical nucleus is just the ratio of 
critical nucleus and unit cell volumes. Inasmuch as gold has the FCC crystal 
structure (and a cubic unit cell), its unit cell volume is just a 3 , where a is the 
lattice parameter (i.e., unit cell edge length); its value is 0.413 nm, as cited in 
the problem statement. Therefore, the number of unit cells found in a radius 
of critical size is just

Inasmuch as there is the equivalence of four atoms per FCC unit cell (Sec¬ 
tion 3.4), the total number of atoms per critical nucleus is just 

(137 unit cells/critical nucleus)(4 atoms/unit cell) = 548 atoms/critical nucleus 


Heterogeneous Nucleation 

Although levels of supercooling for homogeneous nucleation may be significant (on 
occasion several hundred degrees Celsius), in practical situations they are often 
on the order of only several degrees Celsius. The reason for this is that the activa¬ 
tion energy (i.e., energy barrier) for nucleation (AG* of Equation 10.4) is lowered 
when nuclei form on preexisting surfaces or interfaces, because the surface free en- 
ergy (y of Equation 10.4) is reduced. In other words, it is easier for nucleation to

occur at surfaces and interfaces than at other sites. Again, this type of nucleation is 
termed heterogeneous. 

In order to understand this phenomenon, let us consider the nucleation, on a 
flat surface, of a solid particle from a liquid phase. It is assumed that both the liq¬ 
uid and solid phases “wet” this flat surface, that is, both of these phases spread out 
and cover the surface; this configuration is depicted schematically in Figure 10.5. 
Also noted in the figure are three interfacial energies (represented as vectors) that 
exist at two-phase boundaries—y SL , y SI , and yi L —as well as the wetting angle 6 (the 
angle between the y SI and y SL vectors). Taking a surface tension force balance in 
the plane of the flat surface leads to the following expression: 

Til = Tsi + 7 slCOS0 (10.12) 


Now, using a somewhat involved procedure similar to the one presented above 
for homogeneous nucleation (which we have chosen to omit), it is possible to de¬ 
rive equations for r* and AG*; these are as follows: 


r 


* — 



(10.13) 


AG* = 



(10.14) 


The S(0) term of this last equation is a function only of 6 (i.e., the shape of the nu¬ 
cleus), which will have a numerical value between zero and unity. 1 

From Equation 10.13, it is important to note that the critical radius r* for hetero¬ 
geneous nucleation is the same as for homogeneous, inasmuch as y SL is the same sur¬ 
face energy as y in Equation 10.3. It is also evident that the activation energy barrier 
for heterogeneous nucleation (Equation 10.14) is smaller than the homogeneous bar¬ 
rier (Equation 10.4) by an amount corresponding to the value of this S(0) function, or 


AG*et = A Gg om S(6) (10.15) 

Figure 10.6, a schematic graph of AG versus nucleus radius, plots curves for both 
types of nucleation, and indicates the difference in the magnitudes of AGh' et and 
AGho m , in addition to the constancy of r*.This lower AG* for heterogeneous means 
that a smaller energy must be overcome during the nucleation process (than for 


1 For example, for 6 angles of 30° and 90°, values of S(0) are approximately 0.01 and 0.5, 
respectively.

homogeneous), and, therefore, heterogeneous nucleation occurs more readily 
(Equation 10.10). In terms of the nucleation rate, the TV-versus-T curve (Figure 
10.4c) is shifted to higher temperatures for heterogeneous. This effect is repre¬ 
sented in Figure 10.7, which also shows that a much smaller degree of supercool¬ 
ing (AT) is required for heterogeneous nucleation. 

Growth 

The growth step in a phase transformation begins once an embryo has exceeded 
the critical size, r*, and becomes a stable nucleus. Note that nucleation will continue 
to occur simultaneously with growth of the new phase particles; of course, nucle¬ 
ation cannot occur in regions that have already transformed to the new phase. Fur¬ 
thermore, the growth process will cease in any region where particles of the new 
phase meet, because here the transformation will have reached completion. 

Particle growth occurs by long-range atomic diffusion, which normally involves 
several steps—for example, diffusion through the parent phase, across a phase 
boundary, and then into the nucleus. Consequently, the growth rate G is determined

both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation. 
Degree of supercooling (AT) for each is also shown.

by the rate of diffusion, and its temperature dependence is the same as for the dif¬ 
fusion coefficient (Equation 5.8)—namely, 



where Q (the activation energy) and C (a preexponential) are independent of tem¬ 
perature. 2 The temperature dependence of G is represented by one of the curves 
in Figure 10.8; also shown is a curve for the nucleation rate, N (again, almost al¬ 
ways the rate for heterogeneous nucleation). Now, at a specific temperature, the 
overall transformation rate is equal to some product of N and G. The third curve 
of Figure 10.8, which is for the total rate, represents this combined effect. The gen¬ 
eral shape of this curve is the same as for the nucleation rate, in that it has a peak 
or maximum that has been shifted upward relative to the N curve. 

Whereas this treatment on transformations has been developed for solidification, 
the same general principles also apply to solid-solid and solid-gas transformations. 

As we shall see later, the rate of transformation and the time required for the 
transformation to proceed to some degree of completion (e.g., time to 50% reac¬ 
tion completion, t 05 ) are inversely proportional to one another (Equation 10.18). 
Thus, if the logarithm of this transformation time (i.e., log t 0 5 ) is plotted versus tem¬ 
perature, a curve having the general shape shown in Figure 10.9 b results. This

kinetics 


“C-shaped” curve is a virtual mirror image (through a vertical plane) of the trans¬ 
formation rate curve of Figure 10.8, as demonstrated in Figure 10.9. The kinetics of 
phase transformations are often represented using logarithm time- (to some degree 
of transformation) versus-temperature plots (for example, see Section 10.5). 

Several physical phenomena may be explained in terms of the transformation 
rate-versus-temperature curve of Figure 10.8. First, the size of the product phase 
particles will depend on transformation temperature. For example, for transforma¬ 
tions that occur at temperatures near T m , corresponding to low nucleation and high 
growth rates, few nuclei form that grow rapidly. Thus, the resulting microstructure 
will consist of few and relatively large phase particles (e.g., coarse grains). Con¬ 
versely, for transformations at lower temperatures, nucleation rates are high and 
growth rates low, which results in many small particles (e.g., fine grains). 

Also, from Figure 10.8, when a material is cooled very rapidly through the tem¬ 
perature range encompassed by the transformation rate curve to a relatively low 
temperature where the rate is extremely low, it is possible to produce nonequilib¬ 
rium phase structures (for example, see Sections 10.5 and 11.9). 

Kinetic Considerations of Solid-State Transformations 

The previous discussion of this section has centered on the temperature depen¬ 
dences of nucleation, growth, and transformation rates. The time dependence of rate 
(which is often termed the kinetics of a transformation) is also an important 
consideration, often in the heat treatment of materials. Also, because many trans¬ 
formations of interest to materials scientists and engineers involve only solid phases, 
we have decided to devote the following discussion to the kinetics of solid-state 
transformations. 

With many kinetic investigations, the fraction of reaction that has occurred is 
measured as a function of time while the temperature is maintained constant. Trans¬ 
formation progress is usually ascertained by either microscopic examination or 
measurement of some physical property (such as electrical conductivity) whose mag¬ 
nitude is distinctive of the new phase. Data are plotted as the fraction of trans¬ 
formed material versus the logarithm of time; an S-shaped curve similar to that in 
Figure 10.10 represents the typical kinetic behavior for most solid-state reactions. 
Nucleation and growth stages are also indicated in the figure. 

For solid-state transformations displaying the kinetic behavior in Figure 10.10, 
the fraction of transformation y is a function of time t as follows:

reacted versus the logarithm of 
time typical of many solid-state 
transformations in which 
temperature is held constant.

Temperature will have a profound influence on the kinetics and thus on the rate 
of a transformation. This is demonstrated in Figure 10.11, where y-versus-log t 
S-shaped curves at several temperatures for the recrystallization of copper are shown. 

A detailed discussion on the influence of both temperature and time on phase 
transformations is provided in Section 10.5. 


10.4 METASTABLE VERSUS EQUILIBRIUM STATES 

Phase transformations may be wrought in metal alloy systems by varying temper¬ 
ature, composition, and the external pressure; however, temperature changes by 
means of heat treatments are most conveniently utilized to induce phase transfor¬ 
mations. This corresponds to crossing a phase boundary on the composition- 
temperature phase diagram as an alloy of given composition is heated or cooled. 

During a phase transformation, an alloy proceeds toward an equilibrium state 
that is characterized by the phase diagram in terms of the product phases, their 
compositions, and relative amounts. As the previous section noted, most phase trans¬ 
formations require some finite time to go to completion, and the speed or rate is 
often important in the relationship between the heat treatment and the develop¬ 
ment of microstructure. One limitation of phase diagrams is their inability to indi¬ 
cate the time period required for the attainment of equilibrium. 

The rate of approach to equilibrium for solid systems is so slow that true equi¬ 
librium structures are rarely achieved. When phase transformations are induced by 
temperature changes, equilibrium conditions are maintained only if heating or

supercooling

cooling is carried out at extremely slow and unpractical rates. For other than equi¬ 
librium cooling, transformations are shifted to lower temperatures than indicated 
by the phase diagram; for heating, the shift is to higher temperatures. These phe¬ 
nomena are termed supercooling and superheating, respectively. The degree of each 
depends on the rate of temperature change; the more rapid the cooling or heating, 
the greater the supercooling or superheating. For example, for normal cooling rates 
the iron-carbon eutectoid reaction is typically displaced 10 to 20°C (18 to 36°F) 
below the equilibrium transformation temperature. 3 

For many technologically important alloys, the preferred state or microstruc¬ 
ture is a metastable one, intermediate between the initial and equilibrium states; on 
occasion, a structure far removed from the equilibrium one is desired. It thus be¬ 
comes imperative to investigate the influence of time on phase transformations. This 
kinetic information is, in many instances, of greater value than a knowledge of the 
final equilibrium state. 


Microstructural and Property Changes in 
Iron-Carbon Alloys, 

Some of the basic kinetic principles of solid-state transformations are now ex¬ 
tended and applied specifically to iron-carbon alloys in terms of the relationships 
among heat treatment, the development of microstructure, and mechanical prop¬ 
erties. This system has been chosen because it is familiar and because a wide vari¬ 
ety of microstructures and mechanical properties are possible for iron-carbon (or 
steel) alloys.

which is fundamental to the development of microstructure in steel alloys. Upon 
cooling, austenite, having an intermediate carbon concentration, transforms to a fer¬ 
rite phase, having a much lower carbon content, and also cementite, with a much 
higher carbon concentration. Pearlite is one microstructural product of this trans¬ 
formation (Figure 9.27), and the mechanism of pearlite formation was discussed 
previously (Section 9.19) and demonstrated in Figure 9.28. 

Temperature plays an important role in the rate of the austenite-to-pearlite 
transformation. The temperature dependence for an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid

tions in Section 10.3 are constrained to the condition of constant temperature. By way of 
contrast, the discussion of this section pertains to phase transformations that occur with 
changing temperature. This same distinction exists between Sections 10.5 (Isothermal 
Transformation Diagrams) and 10.6 (Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagrams).

/ Phase Transformations 

Two solid curves are plotted; one represents the time required at each temperature 
for the initiation or start of the transformation; the other is for the transformation 
conclusion. The dashed curve corresponds to 50% of transformation completion. 
These curves were generated from a series of plots of the percentage transforma¬ 
tion versus the logarithm of time taken over a range of temperatures. The S-shaped 
curve [for 675°C (1247°F)], in the upper portion of Figure 10.13, illustrates how the 
data transfer is made. 

In interpreting this diagram, note first that the eutectoid temperature [727°C 
(1341°F)] is indicated by a horizontal line; at temperatures above the eutectoid and 
for all times, only austenite will exist, as indicated in the figure. The austenite-to-pearlite 
transformation will occur only if an alloy is supercooled to below the eutectoid; as 
indicated by the curves, the time necessary for the transformation to begin and then 
end depends on temperature. The start and finish curves are nearly parallel, and they 
approach the eutectoid line asymptotically. To the left of the transformation start 
curve, only austenite (which is unstable) will be present, whereas to the right of the 
finish curve, only pearlite will exist. In between, the austenite is in the process of 
transforming to pearlite, and thus both microconstituents will be present. 

According to Equation 10.18, the transformation rate at some particular tem¬ 
perature is inversely proportional to the time required for the reaction to proceed 
to 50% completion (to the dashed line in Figure 10.13). That is, the shorter this time, 
the higher is the rate. Thus, from Figure 10.13, at temperatures just below the eu¬ 
tectoid (corresponding to just a slight degree of undercooling) very long times (on 
the order of 10 5 s) are required for the 50% transformation, and therefore the re¬ 
action rate is very slow. The transformation rate increases with decreasing temper¬ 
ature such that at 540°C (1000°F) only about 3 s is required for the reaction to go 
to 50% completion. 

Several constraints are imposed on using diagrams like Figure 10.13. First, this 
particular plot is valid only for an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition; for 
other compositions, the curves will have different configurations. In addition, these 
plots are accurate only for transformations in which the temperature of the alloy 
is held constant throughout the duration of the reaction. Conditions of constant 
temperature are termed isothermal; thus, plots such as Figure 10.13 are referred to 
as isothermal transformation diagrams, or sometimes as time-temperature- 
transformation (or T-T-T) plots. 

An actual isothermal heat treatment curve (. ABCD ) is superimposed on the 
isothermal transformation diagram for a eutectoid iron-carbon alloy in Figure 10.14. 
Very rapid cooling of austenite to a temperature is indicated by the near-vertical 
line AB , and the isothermal treatment at this temperature is represented by the 
horizontal segment BCD. Of course, time increases from left to right along this line. 
The transformation of austenite to pearlite begins at the intersection, point C (af¬ 
ter approximately 3.5 s), and has reached completion by about 15 s, corresponding 
to point D. Figure 10.14 also shows schematic microstructures at various times dur¬ 
ing the progression of the reaction. 

The thickness ratio of the ferrite and cementite layers in pearlite is approxi¬ 
mately 8 to 1. However, the absolute layer thickness depends on the temperature 
at which the isothermal transformation is allowed to occur. At temperatures just 
below the eutectoid, relatively thick layers of both the a-ferrite and Fe 3 C phases 
are produced; this microstructure is called coarse pearlite, and the region at which 
it forms is indicated to the right of the completion curve on Figure 10.14. At these 
temperatures, diffusion rates are relatively high, such that during the transforma¬ 
tion illustrated in Figure 9.28 carbon atoms can diffuse relatively long distances, 
which results in the formation of thick lamellae. With decreasing temperature, the

carbon diffusion rate decreases, and the layers become progressively thinner. The 
thin-layered structure produced in the vicinity of 540°C is termed fine pearlite; this 
is also indicated in Figure 10.14. To be discussed in Section 10.7 is the dependence 
of mechanical properties on lamellar thickness. Photomicrographs of coarse and 
fine pearlite for a eutectoid composition are shown in Figure 10.15.

For iron-carbon alloys of other compositions, a proeutectoid phase (either fer¬ 
rite or cementite) will coexist with pearlite, as discussed in Section 9.19. Thus 
additional curves corresponding to a proeutectoid transformation also must be 
included on the isothermal transformation diagram. A portion of one such diagram 
for a 1.13 wt% C alloy is shown in Figure 10.16. 

Bainite 

In addition to pearlite, other microconstituents that are products of the austenitic 
transformation exist; one of these is called bainite. The microstructure of bainite 
consists of ferrite and cementite phases, and thus diffusional processes are involved 
in its formation. Bainite forms as needles or plates, depending on the temperature 
of the transformation; the microstructural details of bainite are so fine that their 
resolution is possible only using electron microscopy. Figure 10.17 is an electron 
micrograph that shows a grain of bainite (positioned diagonally from lower left to

upper right). It is composed of a ferrite matrix and elongated particles of Fe 3 C; the 
various phases in this micrograph have been labeled. In addition, the phase that 
surrounds the needle is martensite, the topic addressed by a subsequent section. 
Furthermore, no proeutectoid phase forms with bainite. 

The time-temperature dependence of the bainite transformation may also be 
represented on the isothermal transformation diagram. It occurs at temperatures 
below those at which pearlite forms; begin-, end-, and half-reaction curves are just 
extensions of those for the pearlitic transformation, as shown in Figure 10.18, the 
isothermal transformation diagram for an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composi¬ 
tion that has been extended to lower temperatures. All three curves are C-shaped 
and have a “nose” at point N, where the rate of transformation is a maximum. As 
may be noted, whereas pearlite forms above the nose [i.e., over the temperature 
range of about 540 to 727°C (1000 to 1341°F)], at temperatures between about 215 
and 540°C (420 and 1000°F), bainite is the transformation product. 

It should also be noted that pearlitic and bainitic transformations are really 
competitive with each other, and once some portion of an alloy has transformed to 
either pearlite or bainite, transformation to the other microconstituent is not pos¬ 
sible without reheating to form austenite. 

Spheroidite 

If a steel alloy having either pearlitic or bainitic microstructures is heated to, and 
left at, a temperature below the eutectoid for a sufficiently long period of time— 
for example, at about 700°C (1300°F) for between 18 and 24 h—yet another mi¬ 
crostructure will form. It is called spheroidite (Figure 10.19). Instead of the alter¬ 
nating ferrite and cementite lamellae (pearlite), or the microstructure observed for 
bainite, the Fe 3 C phase appears as spherelike particles embedded in a continuous 
a-phase matrix. This transformation has occurred by additional carbon diffusion 
with no change in the compositions or relative amounts of ferrite and cementite 
phases. The driving force for this transformation is the reduction in a-Fe 3 C phase

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


martensite 


Martensite 

Yet another microconstituent or phase called martensite is formed when austenitized 
iron-carbon alloys are rapidly cooled (or quenched) to a relatively low temperature (in 
the vicinity of the ambient). Martensite is a nonequilibrium single-phase structure that 
results from a diffusionless transformation of austenite. It may be thought of as a trans¬ 
formation product that is competitive with pearlite and bainite. The martensitic trans¬ 
formation occurs when the quenching rate is rapid enough to prevent carbon diffusion. 
Any diffusion whatsoever will result in the formation of ferrite and cementite phases. 

The martensitic transformation is not well understood. However, large num¬ 
bers of atoms experience cooperative movements, in that there is only a slight dis¬ 
placement of each atom relative to its neighbors. This occurs in such a way that the 
FCC austenite experiences a polymorphic transformation to a body-centered tetra¬ 
gonal (BCT) martensite. A unit cell of this crystal structure (Figure 10.20) is simply

a body-centered cube that has been elongated along one of its dimensions; this struc¬ 
ture is distinctly different from that for BCC ferrite. All the carbon atoms remain 
as interstitial impurities in martensite; as such, they constitute a supersaturated solid 
solution that is capable of rapidly transforming to other structures if heated to tem¬ 
peratures at which diffusion rates become appreciable. Many steels, however, retain 
their martensitic structure almost indefinitely at room temperature. 

The martensitic transformation is not, however, unique to iron-carbon alloys. 
It is found in other systems and is characterized, in part, by the diffusionless 
transformation. 

Because the martensitic transformation does not involve diffusion, it occurs 
almost instantaneously; the martensite grains nucleate and grow at a very rapid rate— 
the velocity of sound within the austenite matrix. Thus the martensitic transforma¬ 
tion rate, for all practical purposes, is time independent. 

Martensite grains take on a platelike or needlelike appearance, as indicated in 
Figure 10.21. The white phase in the micrograph is austenite (retained austenite) 
that did not transform during the rapid quench. As already mentioned, martensite 
as well as other microconstituents (e.g., pearlite) can coexist. 

Being a nonequilibrium phase, martensite does not appear on the iron-iron car¬ 
bide phase diagram (Figure 9.24). The austenite-to-martensite transformation is, how¬ 
ever, represented on the isothermal transformation diagram. Because the martensitic 
transformation is diffusionless and instantaneous, it is not depicted in this diagram 
as the pearlitic and bainitic reactions are. The beginning of this transformation is 
represented by a horizontal line designated M{ start) (Figure 10.22). Two other hori¬ 
zontal and dashed lines, labeled M{ 50%) and M{ 90%), indicate percentages of the 
austenite-to-martensite transformation. The temperatures at which these lines are lo¬ 
cated vary with alloy composition but, nevertheless, must be relatively low because 
carbon diffusion must be virtually nonexistent. 4 The horizontal and linear character 


4 The alloy that is the subject of Figure 10.21 is not an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid 
composition; furthermore, its 100% martensite transformation temperature lies below the 
ambient. Because the photomicrograph was taken at room temperature, some austenite 
(i.e., the retained austenite) is present, having not transformed to martensite.

of these lines indicates that the martensitic transformation is independent of time; it 
is a function only of the temperature to which the alloy is quenched or rapidly cooled. 
A transformation of this type is termed an athermal transformation. 

Consider an alloy of eutectoid composition that is very rapidly cooled from a 
temperature above 727°C (1341°F) to, say, 165°C (330°F). From the isothermal trans¬ 
formation diagram (Figure 10.22) it may be noted that 50% of the austenite will 
immediately transform to martensite; as long as this temperature is maintained, 
there will be no further transformation. 

The presence of alloying elements other than carbon (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mo, and W) 
may cause significant changes in the positions and shapes of the curves in the isother¬ 
mal transformation diagrams. These include (1) shifting to longer times the nose of 
the austenite-to-pearlite transformation (and also a proeutectoid phase nose, if such 
exists), and (2) the formation of a separate bainite nose. These alterations may be 
observed by comparing Figures 10.22 and 10.23, which are isothermal transforma¬ 
tion diagrams for carbon and alloy steels, respectively. 

Steels in which carbon is the prime alloying element are termed plain carbon 
steels, whereas alloy steels contain appreciable concentrations of other elements, 
including those cited in the preceding paragraph. Section 11.2 tells more about the 
classification and properties of ferrous alloys.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 10.2 

Microstructural Determinations for Three 
Isothermal Heat Treatments 

Using the isothermal transformation diagram for an iron-carbon alloy of eu- 
tectoid composition (Figure 10.22), specify the nature of the final microstruc¬ 
ture (in terms of microconstituents present and approximate percentages) of 
a small specimen that has been subjected to the following time-temperature 
treatments. In each case assume that the specimen begins at 760°C (1400°F) 
and that it has been held at this temperature long enough to have achieved a 
complete and homogeneous austenitic structure. 

(a) Rapidly cool to 350°C (660°F), hold for 10 4 s, and quench to room temper¬ 
ature. 

(b) Rapidly cool to 250°C (480°F), hold for 100 s, and quench to room tem¬ 
perature. 

(c) Rapidly cool to 650°C (1200°F), hold for 20 s, rapidly cool to 400°C (750°F), 
hold for 10 3 s, and quench to room temperature. 

Solution 

The time-temperature paths for all three treatments are shown in Figure 10.24. 
In each case the initial cooling is rapid enough to prevent any transformation 
from occurring. 

(a) At 350°C austenite isothermally transforms to bainite; this reaction begins 
after about 10 s and reaches completion at about 500 s elapsed time. Therefore, 





















by 10 4 s, as stipulated in this problem, 100% of the specimen is bainite, and 
no further transformation is possible, even though the final quenching line 
passes through the martensite region of the diagram. 

(b) In this case it takes about 150 s at 250°C for the bainite transformation to 
begin, so that at 100 s the specimen is still 100% austenite. As the specimen 
is cooled through the martensite region, beginning at about 215°C, progres¬ 
sively more of the austenite instantaneously transforms to martensite. This 
transformation is complete by the time room temperature is reached, such 
that the final microstructure is 100% martensite. 

(c) For the isothermal line at 650°C, pearlite begins to form after about 7 s; 
by the time 20 s has elapsed, only approximately 50% of the specimen has 
transformed to pearlite. The rapid cool to 400°C is indicated by the vertical 
line; during this cooling, very little, if any, remaining austenite will transform 
to either pearlite or bainite, even though the cooling line passes through 
pearlite and bainite regions of the diagram. At 400°C, we begin timing at es¬ 
sentially zero time (as indicated in Figure 10.24); thus, by the time 10 3 s have 
elapsed, all of the remaining 50% austenite will have completely transformed 
to bainite. Upon quenching to room temperature, any further transformation 
is not possible inasmuch as no austenite remains; and so the final microstruc¬ 
ture at room temperature consists of 50% pearlite and 50% bainite.

10.6 CONTINUOUS COOLING TRANSFORMATION 
DIAGRAMS 

Isothermal heat treatments are not the most practical to conduct because an alloy 
must be rapidly cooled to and maintained at an elevated temperature from a higher 
temperature above the eutectoid. Most heat treatments for steels involve the con¬ 
tinuous cooling of a specimen to room temperature. An isothermal transformation 
diagram is valid only for conditions of constant temperature; this diagram must be 
modified for transformations that occur as the temperature is constantly changing. 
For continuous cooling, the time required for a reaction to begin and end is de¬ 
layed. Thus the isothermal curves are shifted to longer times and lower tempera¬ 
tures, as indicated in Figure 10.25 for an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition.

Two cooling curves corresponding to moderately fast and slow rates are superim¬ 
posed and labeled in Figure 10.26, again for a eutectoid steel. The transformation 
starts after a time period corresponding to the intersection of the cooling curve with 
the beginning reaction curve and concludes upon crossing the completion transfor¬ 
mation curve. The microstructural products for the moderately rapid and slow cool¬ 
ing rate curves in Figure 10.26 are fine and coarse pearlite, respectively. 

Normally, bainite will not form when an alloy of eutectoid composition or, for 
that matter, any plain carbon steel is continuously cooled to room temperature. 
This is because all the austenite will have transformed to pearlite by the time the bai¬ 
nite transformation has become possible. Thus, the region representing the austenite- 
pearlite transformation terminates just below the nose (Figure 10.26) as indicated by 
the curve AB. For any cooling curve passing through AB in Figure 10.26, the trans¬ 
formation ceases at the point of intersection; with continued cooling, the unreacted 
austenite begins transforming to martensite upon crossing the M{ start) line. 

With regard to the representation of the martensitic transformation, the M{ start), 
M{ 50%), and M{ 90%) lines occur at identical temperatures for both isothermal and 
continuous cooling transformation diagrams. This may be verified for an iron-carbon 
alloy of eutectoid composition by comparison of Figures 10.22 and 10.25.

transformation diagram for a eutectoid 
iron-carbon alloy and superimposed cooling 
curves, demonstrating the dependence of the 
final microstructure on the transformations 
that occur during cooling. 


For the continuous cooling of a steel alloy, there exists a critical quenching rate, 
which represents the minimum rate of quenching that will produce a totally marten¬ 
sitic structure. This critical cooling rate, when included on the continuous transfor¬ 
mation diagram, will just miss the nose at which the pearlite transformation begins, 
as illustrated in Figure 10.27. As the figure also shows, only martensite will exist for 
quenching rates greater than the critical; in addition, there will be a range of rates 
over which both pearlite and martensite are produced. Finally, a totally pearlitic 
structure develops for low cooling rates. 

Carbon and other alloying elements also shift the pearlite (as well as the proeu- 
tectoid phase) and bainite noses to longer times, thus decreasing the critical cooling 
rate. In fact, one of the reasons for alloying steels is to facilitate the formation of 
martensite so that totally martensitic structures can develop in relatively thick cross 
sections. Figure 10.28 shows the continuous cooling transformation diagram for the 
same alloy steel for which the isothermal transformation diagram is presented in Fig¬ 
ure 10.23. The presence of the bainite nose accounts for the possibility of formation 
of bainite for a continuous cooling heat treatment. Several cooling curves superim¬ 
posed on Figure 10.28 indicate the critical cooling rate, and also how the transfor¬ 
mation behavior and final microstructure are influenced by the rate of cooling. 

Interestingly enough, the critical cooling rate is diminished even by the pres¬ 
ence of carbon. In fact, iron-carbon alloys containing less than about 0.25 wt% car¬ 
bon are not normally heat-treated to form martensite because quenching rates too 
rapid to be practical are required. Other alloying elements that are particularly ef¬ 
fective in rendering steels heat-treatable are chromium, nickel, molybdenum, man¬ 
ganese, silicon, and tungsten; however, these elements must be in solid solution with 
the austenite at the time of quenching.

In summary, isothermal and continuous cooling transformation diagrams are, 
in a sense, phase diagrams in which the parameter of time is introduced. Each is 
experimentally determined for an alloy of specified composition, the variables be¬ 
ing temperature and time. These diagrams allow prediction of the microstructure 
after some time period for constant temperature and continuous cooling heat treat¬ 
ments, respectively.

10.7 MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF 
IRON-CARBON ALLOYS 

We shall now discuss the mechanical behavior of iron-carbon alloys having the mi¬ 
crostructures discussed heretofore—namely, fine and coarse pearlite, spheroidite, 
bainite, and martensite. For all but martensite, two phases are present (ferrite and ce- 
mentite), and so an opportunity is provided to explore several mechanical property- 
microstructure relationships that exist for these alloys. 

Pearlite 

Cementite is much harder but more brittle than ferrite. Thus, increasing the fraction 
of Fe 3 C in a steel alloy while holding other microstructural elements constant will re¬ 
sult in a harder and stronger material. This is demonstrated in Figure 10.29a, in which

Brinell hardness number 


372 * Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations 


the tensile and yield strengths as well as the Brinell hardness number are plotted as 
a function of the weight percent carbon (or equivalently as the percentage of Fe 3 C) 
for steels that are composed of fine pearlite. All three parameters increase with in¬ 
creasing carbon concentration. Inasmuch as cementite is more brittle, increasing its 
content will result in a decrease in both ductility and toughness (or impact energy). 
These effects are shown in Figure 10.29 b for the same fine pearlitic steels. 

The layer thickness of each of the ferrite and cementite phases in the microstruc¬ 
ture also influences the mechanical behavior of the material. Fine pearlite is harder 
and stronger than coarse pearlite, as demonstrated by the upper two curves of Fig¬ 
ure 10.30a, which plots hardness versus the carbon concentration. 

The reasons for this behavior relate to phenomena that occur at the a-Fe 3 C 
phase boundaries. First, there is a large degree of adherence between the two phases 
across a boundary. Therefore, the strong and rigid cementite phase severely re¬ 
stricts deformation of the softer ferrite phase in the regions adjacent to the bound¬ 
ary; thus the cementite may be said to reinforce the ferrite. The degree of this rein¬ 
forcement is substantially higher in fine pearlite because of the greater phase 
boundary area per unit volume of material. In addition, phase boundaries serve as 
barriers to dislocation motion in much the same way as grain boundaries (Section 
7.8). For fine pearlite there are more boundaries through which a dislocation must 
pass during plastic deformation. Thus, the greater reinforcement and restriction of 
dislocation motion in fine pearlite account for its greater hardness and strength.

10.7 Mechanical Behavior of Iron-Carbon Alloys * 373 

Coarse pearlite is more ductile than fine pearlite, as illustrated in Figure 10.30 b, 
which plots percentage reduction in area versus carbon concentration for both 
microstructure types. This behavior results from the greater restriction to plastic 
deformation of the fine pearlite. 

Spheroidite 

Other elements of the microstructure relate to the shape and distribution of the 
phases. In this respect, the cementite phase has distinctly different shapes and 
arrangements in the pearlite and spheroidite microstructures (Figures 10.15 and 
10.19). Alloys containing pearlitic microstructures have greater strength and hard¬ 
ness than do those with spheroidite. This is demonstrated in Figure 10.30a, which 
compares the hardness as a function of the weight percent carbon for spheroidite 
with both the pearlite structure types. This behavior is again explained in terms of 
reinforcement at, and impedance to, dislocation motion across the ferrite-cementite 
boundaries as discussed previously. There is less boundary area per unit volume in 
spheroidite, and consequently plastic deformation is not nearly as constrained, which 
gives rise to a relatively soft and weak material. In fact, of all steel alloys, those that 
are softest and weakest have a spheroidite microstructure. 

As would be expected, spheroidized steels are extremely ductile, much more 
than either fine or coarse pearlite (Figure 10.30Z?). In addition, they are notably 
tough because any crack can encounter only a very small fraction of the brittle ce¬ 
mentite particles as it propagates through the ductile ferrite matrix. 

Bainite 

Because bainitic steels have a finer structure (i.e., smaller a-ferrite and Fe 3 C par¬ 
ticles), they are generally stronger and harder than pearlitic ones; yet they exhibit 
a desirable combination of strength and ductility. Figure 10.31 shows the influ¬ 
ence of transformation temperature on the tensile strength and hardness for an 
iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition; temperature ranges over which 
pearlite and bainite form (consistent with the isothermal transformation diagram 
for this alloy, Figure 10.18) are noted at the top of Figure 10.31. 

Martensite 

Of the various microstructures that may be produced for a given steel alloy, marten¬ 
site is the hardest and strongest and, in addition, the most brittle; it has, in fact, negli¬ 
gible ductility. Its hardness is dependent on the carbon content, up to about 0.6 wt% 
as demonstrated in Figure 10.32, which plots the hardness of martensite and fine

pearlite as a function of weight percent carbon. In contrast to pearlitic steels, strength 
and hardness of martensite are not thought to be related to microstructure. Rather, 
these properties are attributed to the effectiveness of the interstitial carbon atoms in 
hindering dislocation motion (as a solid-solution effect, Section 7.9), and to the rela¬ 
tively few slip systems (along which dislocations move) for the BCT structure. 

Austenite is slightly denser than martensite, and therefore, during the phase trans¬ 
formation upon quenching, there is a net volume increase. Consequently, relatively 
large pieces that are rapidly quenched may crack as a result of internal stresses; this 
becomes a problem especially when the carbon content is greater than about 0.5 wt%.

10.8 Tempered Martensite * 375 


10.8 TEMPERED MARTENSITE 

In the as-quenched state, martensite, in addition to being very hard, is so brittle that 
it cannot be used for most applications; also, any internal stresses that may have 
been introduced during quenching have a weakening effect. The ductility and tough¬ 
ness of martensite may be enhanced and these internal stresses relieved by a heat 
treatment known as tempering. 

Tempering is accomplished by heating a martensitic steel to a temperature be¬ 
low the eutectoid for a specified time period. Normally, tempering is carried out at 
temperatures between 250 and 650°C (480 and 1200°F); internal stresses, however, 
may be relieved at temperatures as low as 200°C (390°F).This tempering heat treat¬ 
ment allows, by diffusional processes, the formation of tempered martensite, according 
to the reaction 

martensite (BCT, single phase) —> tempered martensite {a + Fe 3 C phases) 

( 10 . 20 ) 

where the single-phase BCT martensite, which is supersaturated with carbon, trans¬ 
forms to the tempered martensite, composed of the stable ferrite and cementite 
phases, as indicated on the iron-iron carbide phase diagram. 

The microstructure of tempered martensite consists of extremely small and uni¬ 
formly dispersed cementite particles embedded within a continuous ferrite matrix. 
This is similar to the microstructure of spheroidite except that the cementite parti¬ 
cles are much, much smaller. An electron micrograph showing the microstructure of 
tempered martensite at a very high magnification is presented in Figure 10.33. 

Tempered martensite may be nearly as hard and strong as martensite, but with 
substantially enhanced ductility and toughness. For example, on the hardness- 
versus-weight percent carbon plot of Figure 10.32 is included a curve for tempered 
martensite. The hardness and strength may be explained by the large ferrite- 
cementite phase boundary area per unit volume that exists for the very fine and 
numerous cementite particles. Again, the hard cementite phase reinforces the fer¬ 
rite matrix along the boundaries, and these boundaries also act as barriers to dis¬ 
location motion during plastic deformation. The continuous ferrite phase is also very 
ductile and relatively tough, which accounts for the improvement of these two prop¬ 
erties for tempered martensite. 

The size of the cementite particles influences the mechanical behavior of tem¬ 
pered martensite; increasing the particle size decreases the ferrite-cementite phase

boundary area and, consequently, results in a softer and weaker material yet one 
that is tougher and more ductile. Furthermore, the tempering heat treatment deter¬ 
mines the size of the cementite particles. Heat treatment variables are temperature 
and time, and most treatments are constant-temperature processes. Because carbon 
diffusion is involved in the martensite-tempered martensite transformation, increas¬ 
ing the temperature will accelerate diffusion, the rate of cementite particle growth, 
and, subsequently, the rate of softening. The dependence of tensile and yield strength 
and ductility on tempering temperature for an alloy steel is shown in Figure 10.34. 
Before tempering, the material was quenched in oil to produce the martensitic struc¬ 
ture; the tempering time at each temperature was 1 h. This type of tempering data 
is ordinarily provided by the steel manufacturer. 

The time dependence of hardness at several different temperatures is presented in 
Figure 10.35 for a water-quenched steel of eutectoid composition; the time scale is log¬ 
arithmic. With increasing time the hardness decreases, which corresponds to the growth 
and coalescence of the cementite particles. At temperatures approaching the eutectoid 
[700°C (1300°F)] and after several hours, the microstructure will have become spher- 
oiditic (Figure 10.19), with large cementite spheroids embedded within the continuous 
ferrite phase. Correspondingly, overtempered martensite is relatively soft and ductile.

resulting from tempering at a higher temperature and briefly explain the

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


Temper Embrittlement 

The tempering of some steels may result in a reduction of toughness as measured 
by impact tests (Section 8.6); this is termed temper embrittlement. The phenomenon 
occurs when the steel is tempered at a temperature above about 575°C (1070°F) 
followed by slow cooling to room temperature, or when tempering is carried out at 
between approximately 375 and 575°C (700 and 1070°F). Steel alloys that are sus¬ 
ceptible to temper embrittlement have been found to contain appreciable concen¬ 
trations of the alloying elements manganese, nickel, or chromium and, in addition, 
one or more of antimony, phosphorus, arsenic, and tin as impurities in relatively low 
concentrations. The presence of these alloying elements and impurities shifts the 
ductile-to-brittle transition to significantly higher temperatures; the ambient tem¬ 
perature thus lies below this transition in the brittle regime. It has been observed 
that crack propagation of these embrittled materials is intergranular (Figure 8.7); 
that is, the fracture path is along the grain boundaries of the precursor austenite 
phase. Furthermore, alloy and impurity elements have been found to preferentially 
segregate in these regions. 

Temper embrittlement may be avoided by (1) compositional control and/or (2) 
tempering above 575°C or below 375°C, followed by quenching to room tempera¬ 
ture. Furthermore, the toughness of steels that have been embrittled may be im¬ 
proved significantly by heating to about 600°C (1100°F) and then rapidly cooling 
to below 300°C (570°F).

In this chapter we have discussed several different microstructures that may be pro¬ 
duced in iron-carbon alloys depending on heat treatment. Figure 10.36 summarizes 
the transformation paths that produce these various microstructures. Here, it is as¬

ments; furthermore, the formation of bainite is possible only for alloy steels (not 
plain carbon ones) as outlined earlier. 

Furthermore, microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties of the 
several microconstituents for iron-carbon alloys are summarized in Table 10.2.

10.9 Review of Phase Transformations and Mechanical Properties for Iron-Carbon Alloys * 379 


MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Shape-Memory Alloys 


A relatively new group of metals that exhibit 
an interesting (and practical) phenomenon 
are the shape-memory alloys (or SMAs). One of 
these materials, after being deformed, has the 
ability to return to its predeformed size and shape 
upon being subjected to an appropriate heat treat¬ 
ment—that is, the material “remembers” its previ¬ 
ous size/shape. Deformation normally is carried out 
at a relatively low temperature, whereas shape 
memory occurs upon heating. 5 Materials that have 
been found to be capable of recovering significant 
amounts of deformation (i.e., strain) are nickel- 
titanium alloys (Nitinol, 6 is their trade name), and 
some copper-base alloys (Cu-Zn-Al and Cu-Al-Ni 
alloys). 

A shape-memory alloy is polymorphic (Sec¬ 
tion 3.6)—that is, it may have two crystal struc¬ 
tures (or phases), and the shape-memory effect 
involves phase transformations between them. 
One phase (termed an austenite phase) has a 
body-centered cubic structure that exists at ele¬ 
vated temperatures; its structure is represented 
schematically by the inset shown at stage 1 of 
Figure 10.37. Upon cooling, the austenite trans¬ 
forms spontaneously to a martensite phase, which 
is similar to the martensitic transformation for the 
iron-carbon system (Section 10.5)—that is, it is dif¬ 
fusionless, involves an orderly shift of large groups 
of atoms, and occurs very rapidly, and the degree 
of transformation is dependent on temperature; 
temperatures at which the transformation begins 
and ends are indicated by “M 5 ” and “Mf labels on 
the left vertical axis of Figure 10.37. In addition, 
this martensite is heavily twinned, 7 as represented 
schematically by the stage 2 inset, Figure 10.37. 
Under the influence of an applied stress, deforma¬ 
tion of martensite (i.e., the passage from stage 2 
to stage 3, Figure 10.37) occurs by the migration 
of twin boundaries—some twinned regions grow 
while others shrink; this deformed martensitic 



Time-lapse photograph that demonstrates the shape- 
memory effect. A wire of a shape-memory alloy 
(Nitinol) has been bent and treated such that its 
memory shape spells the word Nitinol. The wire is 
then deformed and, upon heating (by passage of an 
electric current), springs back to its predeformed 
shape; this shape recovery process is recorded on the 
photograph. [Photograph courtesy the Naval Surface 
Warfare Center (previously the Naval Ordnance 
Laboratory)]. 

structure is represented by the stage 3 inset. Fur¬ 
thermore, when the stress is removed, the de¬ 
formed shape is retained at this temperature. 
And, finally, upon subsequent heating to the ini¬ 
tial temperature, the material reverts back to (i.e., 
“remembers”) its original size and shape (stage 4). 
This stage 3-stage 4 process is accompanied 
by a phase transformation from the deformed 
martensite to the original high-temperature 
austenite phase. For these shape-memory alloys, 
the martensite-to-austenite transformation occurs 
over a temperature range, between temperatures 
denoted by “A/’ (austenite start) and “Af (austen¬ 
ite finish) labels on the right vertical axis of 


5 Alloys that demonstrate this phenomenon only upon heating are said to have a one-way shape memory. Some of 
these materials experience size/shape changes on both heating and cooling; these are termed two-way shape 
memory alloys. In this discussion, we discuss the mechanism for only the one-way shape memory. 

6 Nitinol is really an acronym for rackel-t/tanium Aaval Ordnance Laboratory, where this alloy was discovered. 

7 The phenomenon of twinning is described in Section 7.7.

Summary * 381 


Figure 10.37. Of course, this deformation- 
transformation cycle may be repeated for the 
shape-memory material. 

The original shape (to be remembered) is cre¬ 
ated by heating to well above the A f temperature 
(such that the transformation to austenite is com¬ 
plete) and then restraining the material to the de¬ 
sired memory shape for a sufficient time period. 
For example, for Nitinol alloys, a one-hour treat¬ 
ment at 500°C is necessary. 

Although the deformation experienced by 
shape-memory alloys is semipermanent, it is not truly 
“plastic” deformation, as discussed in Section 6.6— 
neither is it strictly “elastic” (Section 6.3). Rather, it 
is termed thermoelastic, because deformation is 
nonpermanent when the deformed material is sub¬ 
sequently heat-treated. The stress-versus-strain be¬ 
havior of a thermoelastic material is presented in 
Figure 10.38. Maximum recoverable deformation 
strains for these materials are on the order of 8%. 

For this Nitinol family of alloys, transforma¬ 
tion temperatures can be made to vary over a wide 
temperature range (between about -200°C and 
110°C), by altering the Ni-Ti ratio, and also by the 
addition of other elements. 

One important SMA application is in weld¬ 
less, shrink-to-fit pipe couplers used for hydraulic 
lines on aircraft, for joints on undersea pipelines, 
and for plumbing on ships and submarines. Each 
coupler (in the form of a cylindrical sleeve) is fab¬ 
ricated so as to have an inside diameter slightly 
smaller than the outside diameter of the pipes to 
be joined. It is then stretched (circumferentially) 
at some temperature well below the ambient. 
Next the coupler is fitted over the pipe junction 
and then heated to room temperature; heating 
causes the coupler to shrink back to its original 
diameter, thus creating a tight seal between the 
two pipe sections. 



Figure 10.38 Typical stress-strain behavior of a 
shape-memory alloy, demonstrating its thermoelastic 
behavior. The solid curve was generated at a 
temperature below that at which the martensitic 
transformation is complete (i.e., M f of Figure 10.37). 
Release of the applied stress corresponds to passing 
from point P to point Q. Subsequent heating to above 
the austenite-completion transformation temperature 
(A f , Figure 10.37) causes the deformed piece to 
resume its original shape (along the dashed curve 
from point Q to point R). [Adapted from ASM

There is a host of other applications for alloys 
displaying this effect—for example, eyeglass 
frames, tooth-straightening braces, collapsible an¬ 
tennas, greenhouse window openers, antiscald 
control valves on showers, women’s foundation- 
garments, fire sprinkler valves, and in biomedical 
applications (such as blood-clot filters, self¬ 
extending coronary stents, and bone anchors). 
Shape-memory alloys also fall into the classifica¬ 
tion of “smart materials” (Section 1.5) because 
they sense and respond to environmental (i.e., 
temperature) changes. 


SUMMARY 


The Kinetics of Phase Transformations 

• Nucleation and growth are the two steps involved in the production of a new phase. 

• Two types of nucleation are possible: homogeneous and heterogeneous. 

For homogeneous, nuclei of the new phase form uniformly throughout the 
parent phase. 

For heterogeneous, nuclei form preferentially at the surfaces of structural in¬ 
homogeneities (e.g., container surfaces, insoluble impurities, etc.). 









382 * Chapter 10 / Phase Transformations 


• For the homogeneous nucleation of a spherical solid particle in a liquid solution, 
expressions for the critical radius (r*) and activation free energy (AG*) are rep¬ 
resented by Equations 10.3 and 10.4, respectively. These two parameters are in¬ 
dicated in the plot of Figure 10.2Z?. 

• The activation free energy for heterogeneous nucleation (AG het ) is lower than 
for homogeneous (AG hom ) as demonstrated on the schematic free energy- 
versus-nucleus radius curves of Figure 10.6. 

• Heterogeneous nucleation occurs more easily than homogeneous, which is re¬ 
flected in a smaller degree of supercooling (AT) is for heterogeneous—that is, 
AT het < AT hom , Figure 10.7. 

• The growth stage of phase particle formation begins once a nucleus has exceeded 
the critical radius (r*). 

• For typical solid transformations, a plot of fraction transformation versus log¬ 
arithm of time yields a sigmoidal-shaped curve, as depicted schematically in 
Figure 10.10. 

• The time dependence of degree of transformation is represented by the Avrami 
equation, Equation 10.17. 

• Transformation rate is taken as the reciprocal of time required for a transforma¬ 
tion to proceed halfway to its completion—Equation 10.18. 

• For transformations that are induced by temperature alterations, when the rate 
of temperature change is such that equilibrium conditions are not maintained, 
transformation temperature is raised (for heating) and lowered (for cooling). 
These phenomena are termed superheating and supercooling, respectively. 


Isothermal Transformation Diagrams 

Continuous Cooling Transformation Diagrams 

• Phase diagrams provide no information as to the time-dependence of transfor¬ 
mation progress. However, the element of time is incorporated into isothermal 
transformation diagrams. These diagrams: 

Plot temperature versus the logarithm of time, with curves for beginning, as 
well as 50% and 100% transformation completion; 

Are generated from a series of plots of percentage transformation versus the 
logarithm of time taken over a range of temperatures (Figure 10.13); 

Are valid only for constant-temperature heat treatments; and 

Permit determination of times at which a phase transformation begins and ends. 

• Isothermal transformation diagrams may be modified for continuous cooling heat 
treatments; isothermal transformation beginning and ending curves are shifted to 
longer times and lower temperatures (Figure 10.25). Intersections with these 
curves of continuous cooling curves represent times at which the transformation 
starts and ceases. 

• Isothermal and continuous cooling transformation diagrams make possible the 
prediction of microstructural products for specified heat treatments. This feature 
was demonstrated for alloys of iron and carbon. 

• Microstructural products for iron-carbon alloys are as follows: 

Coarse and fine pearlite—the alternating a-ferrite and cementite layers are 
thinner for fine pearlite than for coarse. Coarse pearlite forms at higher tem¬ 
peratures (isothermally) and for slower cooling rates (continuous cooling). 

Bainite—has a very fine structure that is composed of a ferrite matrix and 
elongated cementite particles. It forms at lower temperatures/higher cool¬ 
ing rates than fine pearlite. 


Summary * 383 


Spheroidite—is composed of spherelike cementite particles that are embed¬ 
ded in a ferrite matrix. Heating fine/coarse pearlite or bainite at about 
700°C for several hours produces spheroidite. 

Martensite—platelike or needlelike grains of an iron-carbon solid solution 
that has a body-centered tetragonal crystal structure. Martensite is pro¬ 
duced by rapidly quenching austenite to a sufficiently low temperature so 
as to prevent carbon diffusion and the formation of pearlite and/or bainite. 

Tempered martensite—consists of very small cementite particles within a fer¬ 
rite matrix. Heating martensite at temperatures within the range of about 
250 to 650°C will result in its transformation to tempered martensite. 

• The addition of some alloying elements (other than carbon) shift pearlite and 
bainite noses on a continuous cooling transformation diagram to longer times, 
making the transformation to martensite more favorable (and an alloy more heat- 
treatable). 

Mechanical Behavior of Iron-Carbon Alloys 

• Martensitic steels are the hardest and strongest, yet most brittle. 

• Tempered martensite is very strong but relatively ductile. 

• Bainite has desirable strength-ductility combination but is not as strong as tem¬ 
pered martensite. 

• Fine pearlite is harder, stronger, and more brittle than coarse pearlite. 

• Spheroidite is the softest and most ductile of the microstructures discussed. 

• Embrittlement of some steel alloys results when specific alloying and impurity 
elements are present and upon tempering within a definite temperature range. 

Shape-Memory Alloys 

• These alloys may be deformed and then return to their predeformed sizes/shapes 
upon heating. 

• Deformation occurs by the migration of twin boundaries. A martensite-to-austenite 
phase transformation accompanies the reversion back to the original size/shape.

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

For iron-carbon alloys, in addition to discussions of the heat treatments that pro¬ 
duce the several microconstituents (fine/coarse pearlite, bainite, martensite, etc.) 
and the mechanical properties of same, correlations were made between mechani¬ 
cal properties and structural elements of these microconstituents. These correlations 
are indicated in the following diagram.

Furthermore, reference to the heat treating of steels (as discussed in Chapter 
11) normally means tempering of martensite to form tempered martensite. An 
understanding of the conditions under which martensite forms is facilitated by 
utilizing continuous cooling and isothermal transformation diagrams (Sections 10.5 
and 10.6). In addition, these diagrams are just extensions of the iron-iron carbide 
phase diagram (Section 9.18). The following diagram notes these relationships.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 


The Kinetics of Phase Transformations 

10.1 Name the two stages involved in the forma¬ 
tion of particles of a new phase. Briefly de¬ 
scribe each. 

10.2 (a) Rewrite the expression for the total free 
energy change for nucleation (Equation 
10.1) for the case of a cubic nucleus of edge 
length a (instead of a sphere of radius r). 
Now differentiate this expression with re¬ 
spect to a (per Equation 10.2) and solve for 


both the critical cube edge length, a*, and 
also AG*. 

(b) Is AG* greater for a cube or a sphere? 
Why? 

10.3 If copper (which has a melting point of 
1085°C) homogeneously nucleates at 849°C, 
calculate the critical radius given values of 
-1.77 X 10 9 J/m 3 and 0.200 J/m 2 , respectively, 
for the latent heat of fusion and the surface 
free energy.

10.4 (a) For the solidification of iron, calculate the 
critical radius r* and the activation free en¬ 
ergy AG* if nucleation is homogeneous. Val¬ 
ues for the latent heat of fusion and surface 
free energy are -1.85 X 10 9 J/m 3 and 0.204 
J/m 2 , respectively. Use the supercooling value 
found in Table 10.1. 

(b) Now calculate the number of atoms found 
in a nucleus of critical size. Assume a lattice 
parameter of 0.292 nm for solid iron at its 
melting temperature. 

10.5 (a) Assume for the solidification of iron 
(Problem 10.4) that nucleation is homoge¬ 
neous, and the number of stable nuclei is 10 6 
nuclei per cubic meter. Calculate the critical 
radius and the number of stable nuclei that 
exist at the following degrees of supercooling:

of these critical radii and the numbers of sta¬ 
ble nuclei? 

10.6 For some transformation having kinetics that 
obey the Avrami equation (Equation 10.17), 
the parameter n is known to have a value of 
1.7. If, after 100 s, the reaction is 50% com¬ 
plete, how long (total time) will it take the 
transformation to go to 99% completion? 

10.7 Compute the rate of some reaction that obeys 
Avrami kinetics, assuming that the constants n 
and k have values of 3.0 and 7 X 10 -3 , respect¬ 
ively, for time expressed in seconds. 

10.8 It is known that the kinetics of recrystallization 
for some alloy obey the Avrami equation and 
that the value of n in the exponential is 2.5. If, 
at some temperature, the fraction recrystallized 
is 0.40 after 200 min, determine the rate of re¬ 
crystallization at this temperature. 

10.9 The kinetics of the austenite-to-pearlite trans¬ 
formation obey the Avrami relationship. Us¬

rocal of temperature (in K -1 ), and determine 
the activation energy for this recrystallization 
process. (See Section 5.5.) 

(c) By extrapolation, estimate the length of 
time required for 50% recrystallization at

WHY STUDY Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys? 


Engineers are often involved in materials selection deci¬ 
sions, which necessitates that they have some familiarity 
with the general characteristics of a wide variety of 
metals and their alloys (as well as other material types). 
In addition, access to databases containing property 
values for a large number of materials may be required. 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, one reason for studying applications and pro¬ 
cessing of metal alloys is as follows: 


• In Chapter 10, the heat treating of steels was pre¬ 
sented from the perspective of phase transforma¬ 
tions; a processing approach to heat treating is 
employed in this chapter. Our discussions here are 
devoted to annealing procedures as well as 
quenching and tempering to form tempered 
martensite. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Name four different types of steels and, for 
each, cite compositional differences, distinctive 
properties, and typical uses. 

2. Name the five cast iron types and, for each, 
describe its microstructure and note its general 
mechanical characteristics. 

3. Name seven different types of nonferrous al¬ 
loys and, for each, cite its distinctive physical 
and mechanical characteristics. In addition, list 
at least three typical applications. 

4. Name and describe four forming operations 
that are used to shape metal alloys. 

5. Name and describe five casting techniques. 

6. State the purposes of and describe procedures 
for the following heat treatments: process an¬ 
nealing, stress relief annealing, normalizing, full 
annealing, and spheroidizing. 


7. Define hardenabiUty . 

8. Generate a hardness profile for a cylindrical 
steel specimen that has been austenitized and 
then quenched, given the hardenability curve 
for the specific alloy, as well as quenching 
rate-versus-bar diameter information. 

9. Using a phase diagram, describe and explain 
the two heat treatments that are used to pre¬ 
cipitation harden a metal alloy. 

10. Make a schematic plot of room-temperature 
strength (or hardness) versus the logarithm of 
time for a precipitation heat treatment at 
constant temperature. Explain the shape of 
this curve in terms of the mechanism of 
precipitation hardening. 


11.1 INTRODUCTION 

Often a materials problem is really one of selecting the material that has the right 
combination of characteristics for a specific application. Therefore, the people who 
are involved in the decision making should have some knowledge of the available 
options. The first portion of this chapter provides an abbreviated overview of some 
of the commercial alloys and their general properties and limitations. 

Materials selection decisions may also be influenced by the ease with which 
metal alloys may be formed or manufactured into useful components. Alloy prop¬ 
erties are altered by fabrication processes, and, in addition, further property al¬ 
terations may be induced by the employment of appropriate heat treatments. 
Therefore, in the latter sections of this chapter we consider the details of some of 
these treatments, including annealing procedures, the heat treating of steels, and 
precipitation hardening.

11.2 Ferrous Alloys • 393 


Types of Metal Alloys 

Metal alloys, by virtue of composition, are often grouped into two classes—ferrous 
and nonferrous. Ferrous alloys, those in which iron is the principal constituent, in¬ 
clude steels and cast irons. These alloys and their characteristics are the first topics 
of discussion of this section. The nonferrous ones—all alloys that are not iron 
based—are treated next. 

11.2 FERROUS ALLOYS 

ferrous alloy Ferrous alloys— those of which iron is the prime constituent—are produced in larger 

quantities than any other metal type. They are especially important as engineering 
construction materials. Their widespread use is accounted for by three factors: 

(1) iron-containing compounds exist in abundant quantities within the earth’s crust; 

(2) metallic iron and steel alloys may be produced using relatively economical ex¬ 
traction, refining, alloying, and fabrication techniques; and (3) ferrous alloys are 
extremely versatile, in that they may be tailored to have a wide range of mechani¬ 
cal and physical properties. The principal disadvantage of many ferrous alloys is 
their susceptibility to corrosion. This section discusses compositions, microstructures, 
and properties of a number of different classes of steels and cast irons. A taxonomic 
classification scheme for the various ferrous alloys is presented in Figure 11.1.

Steels 

Steels are iron-carbon alloys that may contain appreciable concentrations of other 
alloying elements; there are thousands of alloys that have different compositions 
and/or heat treatments. The mechanical properties are sensitive to the content of 
carbon, which is normally less than 1.0 wt%. Some of the more common steels are 
classified according to carbon concentration—namely, into low-, medium-, and high- 
carbon types. Subclasses also exist within each group according to the concentration 
of other alloying elements. Plain carbon steels contain only residual concentrations 
of impurities other than carbon and a little manganese. For alloy steels, more alloying 
elements are intentionally added in specific concentrations. 

Low-Carbon Steels 

Of all the different steels, those produced in the greatest quantities fall within the 
low-carbon classification. These generally contain less than about 0.25 wt% C and 
are unresponsive to heat treatments intended to form martensite; strengthening is 
accomplished by cold work. Microstructures consist of ferrite and pearlite con¬ 
stituents. As a consequence, these alloys are relatively soft and weak but have out¬ 
standing ductility and toughness; in addition, they are machinable, weldable, and, 
of all steels, are the least expensive to produce. Typical applications include auto¬ 
mobile body components, structural shapes (I-beams, channel and angle iron), and 
sheets that are used in pipelines, buildings, bridges, and tin cans. Tables 11.1a and 
11.1b present the compositions and mechanical properties of several plain low-carbon 
steels. They typically have a yield strength of 275 MPa (40,000 psi), tensile strengths 
between 415 and 550 MPa (60,000 and 80,000 psi), and a ductility of 25%EL. 

Another group of low-carbon alloys are the high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) 
steels. They contain other alloying elements such as copper, vanadium, nickel, and 
molybdenum in combined concentrations as high as 10 wt%, and possess higher 
strengths than the plain low-carbon steels. Most may be strengthened by heat

treatment, giving tensile strengths in excess of 480 MPa (70,000 psi); in addition, 
they are ductile, formable, and machinable. Several are listed in Table 11.1. In nor¬ 
mal atmospheres, the HSLA steels are more resistant to corrosion than the plain 
carbon steels, which they have replaced in many applications where structural 
strength is critical (e.g., bridges, towers, support columns in high-rise buildings, and 
pressure vessels). 

Medium-Carbon Steels 

The medium-carbon steels have carbon concentrations between about 0.25 and 
0.60 wt%. These alloys may be heat-treated by austenitizing, quenching, and then 
tempering to improve their mechanical properties. They are most often utilized 
in the tempered condition, having microstructures of tempered martensite. The 
plain medium-carbon steels have low hardenabilities (Section 11.8) and can be 
successfully heat-treated only in very thin sections and with very rapid quench¬ 
ing rates. Additions of chromium, nickel, and molybdenum improve the capacity 
of these alloys to be heat-treated (Section 11.8), giving rise to a variety of 
strength-ductility combinations. These heat-treated alloys are stronger than the 
low-carbon steels, but at a sacrifice of ductility and toughness. Applications in¬ 
clude railway wheels and tracks, gears, crankshafts, and other machine parts and 
high-strength structural components calling for a combination of high strength, 
wear resistance, and toughness. 

The compositions of several of these alloyed medium-carbon steels are pre¬ 
sented in Table 11.2a. Some comment is in order regarding the designation schemes 
that are also included. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the American 
Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), and the American Society for Testing and Materi¬ 
als (ASTM) are responsible for the classification and specification of steels as well 
as other alloys. The AISI/SAE designation for these steels is a four-digit number: the 
first two digits indicate the alloy content; the last two give the carbon concentration.

The carbon concentration, in weight percent times 100, is inserted in the place of “xx” for 
each specific steel. 

b Except for 13xx alloys, manganese concentration is less than 1.00 wt%. 

Except for 12xx alloys, phosphorus concentration is less than 0.35 wt%. 

Except for llxx and 12xx alloys, sulfur concentration is less than 0.04 wt%. 

Except for 92xx alloys, silicon concentration varies between 0.15 and 0.35 wt%. 


For plain carbon steels, the first two digits are 1 and 0; alloy steels are designated 
by other initial two-digit combinations (e.g., 13, 41, 43). The third and fourth digits 
represent the weight percent carbon multiplied by 100. For example, a 1060 steel is 
a plain carbon steel containing 0.60 wt% C. 

A unified numbering system (UNS) is used for uniformly indexing both fer¬ 
rous and nonferrous alloys. Each UNS number consists of a single-letter prefix fol¬ 
lowed by a five-digit number. The letter is indicative of the family of metals to which 
an alloy belongs. The UNS designation for these alloys begins with a G, followed 
by the AISI/SAE number; the fifth digit is a zero. Table 11.2b contains the me¬ 
chanical characteristics and typical applications of several of these steels, which have 
been quenched and tempered. 

High-Carbon Steels 

The high-carbon steels, normally having carbon contents between 0.60 and 1.4 wt%, 
are the hardest, strongest, and yet least ductile of the carbon steels. They are almost 
always used in a hardened and tempered condition and, as such, are especially wear 
resistant and capable of holding a sharp cutting edge. The tool and die steels are 
high-carbon alloys, usually containing chromium, vanadium, tungsten, and molyb¬ 
denum. These alloying elements combine with carbon to form very hard and wear- 
resistant carbide compounds (e.g., Cr 23 C 6 , V 4 C 3 , and WC). Some tool steel compo¬ 
sitions and their applications are listed in Table 11.3. These steels are utilized as 
cutting tools and dies for forming and shaping materials, as well as in knives, razors, 
hacksaw blades, springs, and high-strength wire.

Stainless Steels 

stainless steel The stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion (rusting) in a variety of envi¬ 

ronments, especially the ambient atmosphere. Their predominant alloying element 
is chromium; a concentration of at least 11 wt% Cr is required. Corrosion resist¬ 
ance may also be enhanced by nickel and molybdenum additions. 

Stainless steels are divided into three classes on the basis of the predominant phase 
constituent of the microstructure—martensitic, ferritic, or austenitic. Table 11.4 lists

several stainless steels, by class, along with composition, typical mechanical proper¬ 
ties, and applications. A wide range of mechanical properties combined with excel¬ 
lent resistance to corrosion make stainless steels very versatile in their applicability. 

Martensitic stainless steels are capable of being heat-treated in such a way that 
martensite is the prime microconstituent. Additions of alloying elements in signifi¬ 
cant concentrations produce dramatic alterations in the iron-iron carbide phase 
diagram (Figure 9.24). For austenitic stainless steels, the austenite (or y) phase field

is extended to room temperature. Ferritic stainless steels are composed of the 
a-ferrite (BCC) phase. Austenitic and ferritic stainless steels are hardened and strength¬ 
ened by cold work because they are not heat-treatable. The austenitic stainless steels 
are the most corrosion resistant because of the high chromium contents and also the 
nickel additions; they are produced in the largest quantities. Both martensitic and 
ferritic stainless steels are magnetic; the austenitic stainlesses are not. 

Some stainless steels are frequently used at elevated temperatures and in se¬ 
vere environments because they resist oxidation and maintain their mechanical in¬ 
tegrity under such conditions; the upper temperature limit in oxidizing atmospheres 
is about 1000°C (1800°F). Equipment employing these steels includes gas turbines, 
high-temperature steam boilers, heat-treating furnaces, aircraft, missiles, and nuclear 
power-generating units. Also included in Table 11.4 is one ultrahigh-strength stain¬ 
less steel (17-7PH), which is unusually strong and corrosion resistant. Strengthen¬ 
ing is accomplished by precipitation-hardening heat treatments (Section 11.9).

cast iron 


Decomposition of 
iron carbide to form 
a-ferrite and 
graphite 


Cast Irons 

Generically, cast irons are a class of ferrous alloys with carbon contents above 2.14 
wt%; in practice, however, most cast irons contain between 3.0 and 4.5 wt% C and, 
in addition, other alloying elements. A reexamination of the iron-iron carbide phase 
diagram (Figure 9.24) reveals that alloys within this composition range become com¬ 
pletely liquid at temperatures between approximately 1150 and 1300°C (2100 and 
2350°F), which is considerably lower than for steels. Thus, they are easily melted 
and amenable to casting. Furthermore, some cast irons are very brittle, and casting 
is the most convenient fabrication technique. 

Cementite (Fe 3 C) is a metastable compound, and under some circumstances it 
can be made to dissociate or decompose to form a-ferrite and graphite, according 
to the reaction 


Fe 3 C—>3Fe(a) + C (graphite) (11.1) 

Thus, the true equilibrium diagram for iron and carbon is not that presented in Fig¬ 
ure 9.24, but rather as shown in Figure 11.2. The two diagrams are virtually identi¬ 
cal on the iron-rich side (e.g., eutectic and eutectoid temperatures for the Fe-Fe 3 C 
system are 1147 and 727°C, respectively, as compared to 1153 and 740°C for Fe-C); 
however, Figure 11.2 extends to 100 wt% C such that graphite is the carbon-rich 
phase, instead of cementite at 6.7 wt% C (Figure 9.24). 

This tendency to form graphite is regulated by the composition and rate of cool¬ 
ing. Graphite formation is promoted by the presence of silicon in concentrations 
greater than about 1 wt%. Also, slower cooling rates during solidification favor 
graphitization (the formation of graphite). For most cast irons, the carbon exists as 
graphite, and both microstructure and mechanical behavior depend on composition 
and heat treatment. The most common cast iron types are gray, nodular, white, mal¬ 
leable, and compacted graphite.

Composition (at% C) 



Gray Iron 

The carbon and silicon contents of gray cast irons vary between 2.5 and 4.0 wt% 
and 1.0 and 3.0 wt%, respectively. For most of these cast irons, the graphite exists 
in the form of flakes (similar to corn flakes), which are normally surrounded by an 
a-ferrite or pearlite matrix; the microstructure of a typical gray iron is shown in Fig¬ 
ure 11.3a. Because of these graphite flakes, a fractured surface takes on a gray ap¬ 
pearance, hence its name.

ductile (nodular) 
iron 


white cast iron 


/ Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 

Mechanically, gray iron is comparatively weak and brittle in tension as a con¬ 
sequence of its microstructure; the tips of the graphite flakes are sharp and pointed 
and may serve as points of stress concentration when an external tensile stress is 
applied. Strength and ductility are much higher under compressive loads. Typical 
mechanical properties and compositions of several of the common gray cast irons 
are listed in Table 11.5. Gray irons do have some desirable characteristics and are 
utilized extensively. They are very effective in damping vibrational energy; this is 
represented in Figure 11.4, which compares the relative damping capacities of steel 
and gray iron. Base structures for machines and heavy equipment that are exposed 
to vibrations are frequently constructed of this material. In addition, gray irons 
exhibit a high resistance to wear. Furthermore, in the molten state they have a high 
fluidity at casting temperature, which permits casting pieces that have intricate 
shapes; also, casting shrinkage is low. Finally, and perhaps most important, gray cast 
irons are among the least expensive of all metallic materials. 

Gray irons having microstructures different from that shown in Figure 11.3a 
may be generated by adjustment of composition and/or by using an appropriate 
treatment. For example, lowering the silicon content or increasing the cooling rate 
may prevent the complete dissociation of cementite to form graphite (Equation 
11.1). Under these circumstances the microstructure consists of graphite flakes em¬ 
bedded in a pearlite matrix. Figure 11.5 compares schematically the several cast 
iron microstructures obtained by varying the composition and heat treatment. 

Ductile (or Nodular) Iron 

Adding a small amount of magnesium and/or cerium to the gray iron before cast¬ 
ing produces a distinctly different microstructure and set of mechanical properties. 
Graphite still forms, but as nodules or spherelike particles instead of flakes. The re¬ 
sulting alloy is called ductile or nodular iron, and a typical microstructure is shown 
in Figure 11.36. The matrix phase surrounding these particles is either pearlite or 
ferrite, depending on heat treatment (Figure 11.5); it is normally pearlite for an as- 
cast piece. However, a heat treatment for several hours at about 700°C (1300°F) will 
yield a ferrite matrix as in this photomicrograph. Castings are stronger and much 
more ductile than gray iron, as a comparison of their mechanical properties in Table 
11.5 shows. In fact, ductile iron has mechanical characteristics approaching those of 
steel. For example, ferritic ductile irons have tensile strengths ranging between 380 
and 480 MPa (55,000 and 70,000 psi), and ductilities (as percent elongation) from 
10% to 20%. Typical applications for this material include valves, pump bodies, 
crankshafts, gears, and other automotive and machine components. 

White Iron and Malleable Iron 

For low-silicon cast irons (containing less than 1.0 wt% Si) and rapid cooling rates, 
most of the carbon exists as cementite instead of graphite, as indicated in Figure 
11.5. A fracture surface of this alloy has a white appearance, and thus it is termed 
white cast iron. An optical photomicrograph showing the microstructure of white 
iron is presented in Figure 11.3c. Thick sections may have only a surface layer of 
white iron that was “chilled” during the casting process; gray iron forms at interior 
regions, which cool more slowly. As a consequence of large amounts of the cemen¬ 
tite phase, white iron is extremely hard but also very brittle, to the point of being 
virtually unmachinable. Its use is limited to applications that necessitate a very hard 
and wear-resistant surface, without a high degree of ductility—for example, as rollers 
in rolling mills. Generally, white iron is used as an intermediary in the production 
of yet another cast iron, malleable iron.

is presented in Figure 11.3d. The microstructure is similar to that of nodular iron 
(Figure 11.3 b), which accounts for relatively high strength and appreciable ductil¬ 
ity or malleability. Some typical mechanical characteristics are also listed in Table 
11.5. Representative applications include connecting rods, transmission gears, and 
differential cases for the automotive industry, and also flanges, pipe fittings, and 
valve parts for railroad, marine, and other heavy-duty services. 

Gray and ductile cast irons are produced in approximately the same amounts; 
however, white and malleable cast irons are produced in smaller quantities. 



Check 11.2 


It is possible to produce cast irons that consist of a martensite matrix in which 
graphite is embedded in either flake, nodule, or rosette form. Briefly describe the 
treatment necessary to produce each of these three microstructures. 


[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


Compacted Graphite Iron 

compacted graphite A relatively recent addition to the family of cast irons is compacted graphite iron 
iron (abbreviated CGI). As with gray, ductile, and malleable irons, carbon exists as 

graphite, whose formation is promoted by the presence of silicon. Silicon content 
ranges between 1.7 and 3.0 wt%, whereas carbon concentration is normally between 
3.1 and 4.0 wt%. Two CGI materials are included in Table 11.5. 

Microstructurally, the graphite in CGI alloys has a wormlike (or vermicular) 
shape; a typical CGI microstructure is shown in the optical micrograph of Figure 
11. 3e. In a sense, this microstructure is intermediate between that of gray iron (Fig¬ 
ure 11.3a) and ductile (nodular) iron (Figure 113b), and, in fact, some of the graphite 
(less than 20%) may be as nodules. However, sharp edges (characteristic of graphite 
flakes) should be avoided; the presence of this feature leads to a reduction in frac¬ 
ture and fatigue resistance of the material. Magnesium and/or cerium is also added, 
but concentrations are lower than for ductile iron. The chemistries of CGIs are more 
complex than for the other cast iron types; compositions of magnesium, cerium, and 
other additives must be controlled so as to produce a microstructure that consists 
of the wormlike graphite particles, while at the same time limiting the degree of 
graphite nodularity, and preventing the formation of graphite flakes. Furthermore, 
depending on heat treatment, the matrix phase will be pearlite and/or ferrite. 

As with the other types of cast irons, the mechanical properties of CGIs are 
related to microstructure: graphite particle shape as well as the matrix phase/ 
microconstituent. An increase in degree of nodularity of the graphite particles leads 
to enhancements of both strength and ductility. Furthermore, CGIs with ferritic ma¬ 
trices have lower strengths and higher ductilities than those with pearlitic matrices. 
Tensile and yield strengths for compacted graphite irons are comparable to values 
for ductile and malleable irons, yet are greater than those observed for the higher- 
strength gray irons (Table 11.5). In addition, ductilities for CGIs are intermediate 
between values for gray and ductile irons; also, moduli of elasticity range between 
140 and 165 GPa (20 X 10 6 and 24 X 10 6 psi). 

Compared to the other cast iron types, desirable characteristics of CGIs include 
the following: 

• Higher thermal conductivity 





406 * Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 


• Better resistance to thermal shock (i.e., fracture resulting from rapid temperature 
changes) 

• Lower oxidation at elevated temperatures 

Compacted graphite irons are now being used in a number of important 
applications, including diesel engine blocks, exhaust manifolds, gearbox housings, 
brake discs for high-speed trains, and flywheels. 


11.3 NONFERROUS ALLOYS 

Steel and other ferrous alloys are consumed in exceedingly large quantities because 
they have such a wide range of mechanical properties, may be fabricated with relative 
ease, and are economical to produce. However, they have some distinct limitations 
chiefly (1) a relatively high density, (2) a comparatively low electrical conductivity, 
and (3) an inherent susceptibility to corrosion in some common environments. Thus, 
for many applications it is advantageous or even necessary to use other alloys that 
have more suitable property combinations. Alloy systems are classified either ac¬ 
cording to the base metal or according to some specific characteristic that a group 
of alloys share. This section discusses the following metal and alloy systems: cop¬ 
per, aluminum, magnesium, and titanium alloys; the refractory metals; the superal¬ 
loys; the noble metals; and miscellaneous alloys, including those that have nickel, 
lead, tin, zirconium, and zinc as base metals. 

On occasion, a distinction is made between cast and wrought alloys. Alloys that 
are so brittle that forming or shaping by appreciable deformation is not possible 
ordinarily are cast; these are classified as cast alloys. On the other hand, those that 
wrought alloy are amenable to mechanical deformation are termed wrought alloys. 

In addition, the heat-treatability of an alloy system is mentioned frequently. 
“Heat-treatable” designates an alloy whose mechanical strength is improved by pre¬ 
cipitation hardening (Section 11.9) or a martensitic transformation (normally the 
former), both of which involve specific heat-treating procedures. 

Copper and Its Alloys 

Copper and copper-based alloys, possessing a desirable combination of physical 
properties, have been utilized in quite a variety of applications since antiquity. Un¬ 
alloyed copper is so soft and ductile that it is difficult to machine; also, it has an al¬ 
most unlimited capacity to be cold worked. Furthermore, it is highly resistant to 
corrosion in diverse environments including the ambient atmosphere, seawater, and 
some industrial chemicals. The mechanical and corrosion-resistance properties of 
copper may be improved by alloying. Most copper alloys cannot be hardened or 
strengthened by heat-treating procedures; consequently, cold working and/or solid- 
solution alloying must be utilized to improve these mechanical properties, 
brass The most common copper alloys are the brasses, for which zinc, as a substitu¬ 

tional impurity, is the predominant alloying element. As may be observed for the 
copper-zinc phase diagram (Figure 9.19), the a phase is stable for concentrations 
up to approximately 35 wt% Zn. This phase has an FCC crystal structure, and 
a-brasses are relatively soft, ductile, and easily cold worked. Brass alloys having a 
higher zinc content contain both a and (3' phases at room temperature. The /3 r phase 
has an ordered BCC crystal structure and is harder and stronger than the a phase; 
consequently, a + /T alloys are generally hot worked. 

Some of the common brasses are yellow, naval, and cartridge brass; muntz metal; 
and gilding metal. The compositions, properties, and typical uses of several of these

bronze The bronzes are alloys of copper and several other elements, including tin, alu¬ 

minum, silicon, and nickel. These alloys are somewhat stronger than the brasses, yet 
they still have a high degree of corrosion resistance. Table 11.6 contains several of

the bronze alloys, their compositions, properties, and applications. Generally they 
are utilized when, in addition to corrosion resistance, good tensile properties are 
required. 

The most common heat-treatable copper alloys are the beryllium coppers. They 
possess a remarkable combination of properties: tensile strengths as high as 1400 
MPa (200,000 psi), excellent electrical and corrosion properties, and wear resistance 
when properly lubricated; they may be cast, hot worked, or cold worked. High 
strengths are attained by precipitation-hardening heat treatments (Section 11.9). 
These alloys are costly because of the beryllium additions, which range between 1.0 
and 2.5 wt%. Applications include jet aircraft landing gear bearings and bushings, 
springs, and surgical and dental instruments. One of these alloys (C17200) is in¬ 
cluded in Table 11.6.

Aluminum and Its Alloys 

Aluminum and its alloys are characterized by a relatively low density (2.7 g/cm 3 as 
compared to 7.9 g/cm 3 for steel), high electrical and thermal conductivities, and a 
resistance to corrosion in some common environments, including the ambient at¬ 
mosphere. Many of these alloys are easily formed by virtue of high ductility; this is 
evidenced by the thin aluminum foil sheet into which the relatively pure material 
may be rolled. Because aluminum has an FCC crystal structure, its ductility is re¬ 
tained even at very low temperatures. The chief limitation of aluminum is its low 
melting temperature [660°C (1220°F)], which restricts the maximum temperature at 
which it can be used. 

The mechanical strength of aluminum may be enhanced by cold work and by 
alloying; however, both processes tend to diminish resistance to corrosion. Princi¬ 
pal alloying elements include copper, magnesium, silicon, manganese, and zinc. Non¬ 
heat-treatable alloys consist of a single phase, for which an increase in strength is 
achieved by solid-solution strengthening. Others are rendered heat treatable 
(capable of being precipitation hardened) as a result of alloying. In several of these 
alloys, precipitation hardening is due to the precipitation of two elements other than 
aluminum, to form an intermetallic compound such as MgZn 2 . 

Generally, aluminum alloys are classified as either cast or wrought. Composi¬ 
tion for both types is designated by a four-digit number that indicates the principal 
impurities, and in some cases, the purity level. For cast alloys, a decimal point is 
located between the last two digits. After these digits is a hyphen and the basic tem- 
temper designation per designation— a letter and possibly a one- to three-digit number, which indicates 

the mechanical and/or heat treatment to which the alloy has been subjected. For 
example, F, H, and O represent, respectively, the as-fabricated, strain-hardened, and 
annealed states; T3 means that the alloy was solution heat-treated, cold worked, 
and then naturally aged (age hardened). A solution heat treatment followed by ar¬ 
tificial aging is indicated by T6. The compositions, properties, and applications of 
several wrought and cast alloys are contained in Table 11.7. Some of the more com¬ 
mon applications of aluminum alloys include aircraft structural parts, beverage cans, 
bus bodies, and automotive parts (engine blocks, pistons, and manifolds).

410 * Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 

Recent attention has been given to alloys of aluminum and other low-density 
metals (e.g., Mg and Ti) as engineering materials for transportation, to effect re¬ 
ductions in fuel consumption. An important characteristic of these materials is 
specific strength specific strength, which is quantified by the tensile strength-specific gravity ratio. 

Even though an alloy of one of these metals may have a tensile strength that is in¬ 
ferior to a more dense material (such as steel), on a weight basis it will be able to 
sustain a larger load. 

A generation of new aluminum-lithium alloys have been developed recently 
for use by the aircraft and aerospace industries. These materials have relatively 
low densities (between about 2.5 and 2.6 g/cm 3 ), high specific moduli (elastic 
modulus-specific gravity ratios), and excellent fatigue and low-temperature tough¬ 
ness properties. Furthermore, some of them may be precipitation hardened. How¬ 
ever, these materials are more costly to manufacture than the conventional aluminum 
alloys because special processing techniques are required as a result of lithium’s 
chemical reactivity.

Explain why, under some circumstances, it is not advisable to weld a structure that 
is fabricated with a 3003 aluminum alloy. Hint: you may want to consult Section 7.12. 


[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


Magnesium and Its Alloys 

Perhaps the most outstanding characteristic of magnesium is its density, 1.7 g/cm 3 , 
which is the lowest of all the structural metals; therefore, its alloys are used where 
light weight is an important consideration (e.g., in aircraft components). Magnesium 
has an HCP crystal structure, is relatively soft, and has a low elastic modulus: 45 GPa 
(6.5 X 10 6 psi). At room temperature magnesium and its alloys are difficult to de¬ 
form; in fact, only small degrees of cold work may be imposed without annealing. 
Consequently, most fabrication is by casting or hot working at temperatures between 
200 and 350°C (400 and 650°F). Magnesium, like aluminum, has a moderately low 
melting temperature [651°C (1204°F)]. Chemically, magnesium alloys are relatively 
unstable and especially susceptible to corrosion in marine environments. On the other 
hand, corrosion or oxidation resistance is reasonably good in the normal atmosphere; 
it is believed that this behavior is due to impurities rather than being an inherent 
characteristic of Mg alloys. Fine magnesium powder ignites easily when heated in air; 
consequently, care should be exercised when handling it in this state. 

These alloys are also classified as either cast or wrought, and some of them are 
heat-treatable. Aluminum, zinc, manganese, and some of the rare earths are the ma¬ 
jor alloying elements. A composition-temper designation scheme similar to that for 
aluminum alloys is also used. Table 11.8 lists several common magnesium alloys, 
their compositions, properties, and applications. These alloys are used in aircraft and 
missile applications, as well as in luggage. Furthermore, in the last several years the 
demand for magnesium alloys has increased dramatically in a host of different in¬ 
dustries. For many applications, magnesium alloys have replaced engineering plas¬ 
tics that have comparable densities inasmuch as the magnesium materials are stiffer, 
more recyclable, and less costly to produce. For example, magnesium is now em¬ 
ployed in a variety of handheld devices (e.g., chain saws, power tools, hedge clippers), 
in automobiles (e.g., steering wheels and columns, seat frames, transmission cases),

Titanium and Its Alloys 

Titanium and its alloys are relatively new engineering materials that possess an ex¬ 
traordinary combination of properties. The pure metal has a relatively low density 









412 * Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 

(4.5 g/cm 3 ), a high melting point [1668°C (3035°F)], and an elastic modulus of 107 
GPa (15.5 X 10 6 psi). Titanium alloys are extremely strong; room-temperature ten¬ 
sile strengths as high as 1400 MPa (200,000 psi) are attainable, yielding remarkable 
specific strengths. Furthermore, the alloys are highly ductile and easily forged and 
machined. 

Unalloyed (i.e., commercially pure) titanium has a hexagonal close-packed crys¬ 
tal structure, sometimes denoted as the a phase at room temperature. At 883°C 
(1621°F) the HCP material transforms to a body-centered cubic (or f3) phase. This 
transformation temperature is strongly influenced by the presence of alloying ele¬ 
ments. For example, vanadium, niobium, and molybdenum decrease the a-to-/8 
transformation temperature and promote the formation of the (3 phase (i.e., are 
(3 -phase stabilizers), which may exist at room temperature. In addition, for some 
compositions both a and (3 phases will coexist. On the basis of which phase(s) is 
(are) present after processing, titanium alloys fall into four classifications: alpha, 
beta, alpha + beta, and near alpha. 

Alpha titanium alloys, often alloyed with aluminum and tin, are preferred for 
high-temperature applications because of their superior creep characteristics. Fur¬ 
thermore, strengthening by heat treatment is not possible inasmuch as a is the 
stable phase; consequently, these materials are normally utilized in annealed or 
recrystallized states. Strength and toughness are satisfactory, whereas forgeability is 
inferior to the other Ti alloy types. 

The /3 titanium alloys contain sufficient concentrations of beta-stabilizing ele¬ 
ments (V and Mo) such that, upon cooling at sufficiently rapid rates, the (3 
(metastable) phase is retained at room temperature. These materials are highly 
forgeable and exhibit high fracture toughnesses. 

Alpha + beta materials are alloyed with stabilizing elements for both con¬ 
stituent phases. The strength of these alloys may be improved and controlled by 
heat treatment. A variety of microstructures is possible that consist of an a phase 
as well as a retained or transformed f3 phase. In general, these materials are quite 
formable. 

Near-alpha alloys are also composed of both alpha and beta phases, with only 
a small proportion of f3— that is, they contain low concentrations of beta stabilizers. 
Their properties and fabrication characteristics are similar to the alpha materials, 
except that a greater diversity of microstructures and properties are possible for 
near-alpha alloys. 

The major limitation of titanium is its chemical reactivity with other materials 
at elevated temperatures. This property has necessitated the development of non- 
conventional refining, melting, and casting techniques; consequently, titanium alloys 
are quite expensive. In spite of this high temperature reactivity, the corrosion 
resistance of titanium alloys at normal temperatures is unusually high; they are 
virtually immune to air, marine, and a variety of industrial environments. Table 11.9 
presents several titanium alloys along with their typical properties and applications. 
They are commonly utilized in airplane structures, space vehicles, and surgical im¬ 
plants, and in the petroleum and chemical industries. 

The Refractory Metals 

Metals that have extremely high melting temperatures are classified as the refrac¬ 
tory metals. Included in this group are niobium (Nb), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten 
(W), and tantalum (Ta). Melting temperatures range between 2468°C (4474°F) for 
niobium and 3410°C (6170°F), the highest melting temperature of any metal, for 
tungsten. Interatomic bonding in these metals is extremely strong, which accounts

for the melting temperatures, and, in addition, large elastic moduli and high 
strengths and hardnesses, at ambient as well as elevated temperatures. The appli¬ 
cations of these metals are varied. For example, tantalum and molybdenum are al¬ 
loyed with stainless steel to improve its corrosion resistance. Molybdenum alloys 
are utilized for extrusion dies and structural parts in space vehicles; incandescent 
light filaments, x-ray tubes, and welding electrodes employ tungsten alloys. Tanta¬ 
lum is immune to chemical attack by virtually all environments at temperatures 
below 150°C and is frequently used in applications requiring such a corrosion- 
resistant material. 

The Superalloys 

The superalloys have superlative combinations of properties. Most are used in 
aircraft turbine components, which must withstand exposure to severely oxidizing 
environments and high temperatures for reasonable time periods. Mechanical in¬ 
tegrity under these conditions is critical; in this regard, density is an important con¬ 
sideration because centrifugal stresses are diminished in rotating members when 
the density is reduced. These materials are classified according to the predominant 
metal(s) in the alloy, of which there are three groups—iron-nickel, nickel, and cobalt. 
Other alloying elements include the refractory metals (Nb, Mo, W, Ta), chromium, 
and titanium. Furthermore, these alloys are also categorized as wrought or cast. 
Compositions of several of them are presented in Table 11.10. 

In addition to turbine applications, superalloys are utilized in nuclear reactors 
and petrochemical equipment. 

The Noble Metals 

The noble or precious metals are a group of eight elements that have some phys¬ 
ical characteristics in common. They are expensive (precious) and are superior

or notable (noble) in properties—that is, characteristically soft, ductile, and oxi¬ 
dation resistant. The noble metals are silver, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, 
ruthenium, iridium, and osmium; the first three are most common and are used 
extensively in jewelry. Silver and gold may be strengthened by solid-solution 
alloying with copper; sterling silver is a silver-copper alloy containing approxi¬ 
mately 7.5 wt% Cu. Alloys of both silver and gold are employed as dental rest¬ 
oration materials; also, some integrated circuit electrical contacts are of gold. 
Platinum is used for chemical laboratory equipment, as a catalyst (especially in 
the manufacture of gasoline), and in thermocouples to measure elevated 
temperatures. 


Miscellaneous Nonferrous Alloys 

The preceding discussion covers the vast majority of nonferrous alloys; however, a 
number of others are found in a variety of engineering applications, and a brief ex¬ 
posure of these is worthwhile. 

Nickel and its alloys are highly resistant to corrosion in many environments, es¬ 
pecially those that are basic (alkaline). Nickel is often coated or plated on some 
metals that are susceptible to corrosion as a protective measure. Monel, a nickel- 
based alloy containing approximately 65 wt% Ni and 28 wt% Cu (the balance is 
iron), has very high strength and is extremely corrosion resistant; it is used in pumps, 
valves, and other components that are in contact with some acid and petroleum so¬ 
lutions. As already mentioned, nickel is one of the principal alloying elements in 
stainless steels and one of the major constituents in the superalloys. 

Lead, tin, and their alloys find some use as engineering materials. Both are me¬ 
chanically soft and weak, have low melting temperatures, are quite resistant to many 
corrosion environments, and have recrystallization temperatures below room 
temperature. Some common solders are lead-tin alloys, which have low melting 
temperatures. Applications for lead and its alloys include x-ray shields and storage 
batteries. The primary use of tin is as a very thin coating on the inside of plain car¬ 
bon steel cans (tin cans) that are used for food containers; this coating inhibits 
chemical reactions between the steel and the food products. 

Unalloyed zinc also is a relatively soft metal having a low melting temperature 
and a subambient recrystallization temperature. Chemically, it is reactive in a num¬ 
ber of common environments and, therefore, susceptible to corrosion. Galvanized 
steel is just plain carbon steel that has been coated with a thin zinc layer; the zinc 
preferentially corrodes and protects the steel (Section 17.9). Typical applications of 
galvanized steel are familiar (sheet metal, fences, screen, screws, etc.). Common ap¬ 
plications of zinc alloys include padlocks, plumbing fixtures, automotive parts (door 
handles and grilles), and office equipment. 

Although zirconium is relatively abundant in the earth’s crust, not until quite 
recent times were commercial refining techniques developed. Zirconium and its al¬ 
loys are ductile and have other mechanical characteristics that are comparable to 
those of titanium alloys and the austenitic stainless steels. However, the primary 
asset of these alloys is their resistance to corrosion in a host of corrosive media, in¬ 
cluding superheated water. Furthermore, zirconium is transparent to thermal neu¬ 
trons, so that its alloys have been used as cladding for uranium fuel in water-cooled 
nuclear reactors. In terms of cost, these alloys are also often the materials of choice 
for heat exchangers, reactor vessels, and piping systems for the chemical-processing 
and nuclear industries. They are also used in incendiary ordnance and in sealing de¬ 
vices for vacuum tubes.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Metal Alloys Used for Euro Coins 


O n January 1, 2002, the euro became the sin¬ 
gle legal currency in twelve European coun¬ 
tries; since that date, several other nations have 
also joined the European monetary union and 
have adopted the euro as their official currency. 
Euro coins are minted in eight different denomi¬ 
nations: 1 and 2 euros, as well as 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 
and 1 euro cent. Each coin has a common design 
on one face, whereas the reverse face design is one 
of several chosen by the monetary union countries. 
Several of these coins are shown in the photograph 
in Figure 11.6. 

In deciding which metal alloys to use for these 
coins, a number of issues were considered; most of 
them centered on material properties. 

• The ability to distinguish a coin of one denom¬ 
ination from that of another denomination is 
important. This may be accomplished by hav¬ 
ing coins of different sizes, different colors, and 
different shapes. With regard to color, alloys 
must be chosen that retain their distinctive 
colors, which means that they do not easily 
tarnish in the air and other commonly encoun¬ 
tered environments. 

• Security is an important issue—that is, produc¬ 
ing coins that are difficult to counterfeit. Most 
vending machines use electrical conductivity to 
identify coins, to prevent false coins from be¬ 
ing used. This means that each coin must have 
its own unique “electronic signature,” which 
depends on its alloy composition. 



Figure 11.6 Photograph showing 1-euro, 2-euro, 
20-euro-cent, and 50-euro-cent coins. (Photograph 
courtesy of Outokumpu Copper.) 


• The alloys chosen must be “coinable” or easy 
to mint—that is, sufficiently soft and ductile to 
allow design reliefs to be stamped into the 
coin surfaces. 

• Also, the alloys must be wear resistant (i.e., 
hard and strong) for long-term use, and so that 
the reliefs stamped into the coin surfaces are 
retained. Of course, strain hardening (Section 
7.10) occurs during the stamping operation, 
which enhances hardness. 

• Ehgh degrees of corrosion resistance in com¬ 
mon environments are required for the alloys 
selected, to ensure minimal material losses 
over the lifetimes of the coins. 

• It is highly desirable to use alloys of a base 
metal (or metals) that retains (retain) its 
(their) intrinsic value(s). 

• Alloy recyclability is another requirement for 
the alloy(s) used. 

• The alloy(s) from which the coins are made 
should also provide for human health—that is, 
have antibacterial characteristics so that un¬ 
desirable microorganisms will not grow on 
their surfaces. 

Copper was selected as the base metal for all 
euro coins, inasmuch as it and its alloys satisfy 
these criteria. Several different copper alloys and 
alloy combinations are used for the eight differ¬ 
ent coins. These are as follows: 

• 2-euro coin: This coin is termed bimetallic— it 
consists of an outer ring and an inner disk. For 
the outer ring, a 75Cu-25Ni alloy is used, which 
has a silver color. The inner disk is composed of 
a three-layer structure—high-purity nickel that 
is clad on both sides with a nickel brass alloy 
(75Cu-20Zn-5Ni); this alloy has a gold color. 

• 1-euro coin: This coin is also bimetallic, but the 
alloys used for its outer ring and inner disk 
are reversed from those for the 2-euro coin. 

• 50-, 20-, and 10-euro-cent pieces: These coins 
are made of a “Nordic Gold” alloy—89Cu- 
5Al-5Zn-lSn. 

• 5-, 2-, and 1-euro-cent pieces: Copper-plated 
steels are used for these coins.

In Appendix B is tabulated a wide variety of properties (density, elastic mod¬ 
ulus, yield and tensile strengths, electrical resistivity, coefficient of thermal expan¬ 
sion, etc.) for a large number of metals and alloys. 

Fabrication of Metals 


Metal fabrication techniques are normally preceded by refining, alloying and often 
heat-treating processes that produce alloys with the desired characteristics. The clas¬ 
sifications of fabrication techniques include various metal-forming methods, cast¬ 
ing, powder metallurgy, welding, and machining; often two or more of them must 
be used before a piece is finished. The methods chosen depend on several factors; 
the most important are the properties of the metal, the size and shape of the fin¬ 
ished piece, and, of course, cost. The metal fabrication techniques we discuss are 
classified according to the scheme illustrated in Figure 11.7. 


11.4 FORMING OPERATIONS 

Forming operations are those in which the shape of a metal piece is changed by 
plastic deformation; for example, forging, rolling, extrusion, and drawing are com¬ 
mon forming techniques. Of course, the deformation must be induced by an exter¬ 
nal force or stress, the magnitude of which must exceed the yield strength of the 
material. Most metallic materials are especially amenable to these procedures, 
being at least moderately ductile and capable of some permanent deformation 
without cracking or fracturing. 

When deformation is achieved at a temperature above that at which recrystal- 
hot working lization occurs, the process is termed hot working (Section 7.12); otherwise, it is cold 

working. With most of the forming techniques, both hot- and cold-working proce¬ 
dures are possible. For hot-working operations, large deformations are possible, 
which may be successively repeated because the metal remains soft and ductile. 
Also, deformation energy requirements are less than for cold working. However, 
most metals experience some surface oxidation, which results in material loss and 
cold working a poor final surface finish. Cold working produces an increase in strength with the 

attendant decrease in ductility, because the metal strain hardens; advantages over 
hot working include a higher-quality surface finish, better mechanical properties 
and a greater variety of them, and closer dimensional control of the finished piece.

On occasion, the total deformation is accomplished in a series of steps in which the 
piece is successively cold worked a small amount and then process annealed 
(Section 11.7); however, this is an expensive and inconvenient procedure. 

The forming operations to be discussed are illustrated schematically in 
Figure 11.8. 

Forging 

Forging is mechanically working or deforming a single piece of a normally hot metal; 
this may be accomplished by the application of successive blows or by continuous 
squeezing. Forgings are classified as either closed or open die. For closed die, a force 
is brought to bear on two or more die halves having the finished shape such that 
the metal is deformed in the cavity between them (Figure 11.8a). For open die, two 
dies having simple geometric shapes (e.g., parallel flat, semicircular) are employed, 
normally on large workpieces. Forged articles have outstanding grain structures and 
the best combination of mechanical properties. Wrenches, automotive crankshafts, 
and piston connecting rods are typical articles formed using this technique. 

Rolling 

Rolling, the most widely used deformation process, consists of passing a piece of 
metal between two rolls; a reduction in thickness results from compressive stresses 
exerted by the rolls. Cold rolling may be used in the production of sheet, strip, and 
foil with a high-quality surface finish. Circular shapes as well as I-beams and rail¬ 
road rails are fabricated using grooved rolls. 

Extrusion 

For extrusion, a bar of metal is forced through a die orifice by a compressive force 
that is applied to a ram; the extruded piece that emerges has the desired shape 
and a reduced cross-sectional area. Extrusion products include rods and tubing 















































11.5 Casting • 419 


that have rather complicated cross-sectional geometries; seamless tubing may also 
be extruded. 

Drawing 

drawing Drawing is the pulling of a metal piece through a die having a tapered bore by 

means of a tensile force that is applied on the exit side. A reduction in cross sec¬ 
tion results, with a corresponding increase in length. The total drawing operation 
may consist of a number of dies in a series sequence. Rod, wire, and tubing prod¬ 
ucts are commonly fabricated in this way. 


11.5 CASTING 

Casting is a fabrication process whereby a totally molten metal is poured into a 
mold cavity having the desired shape; upon solidification, the metal assumes the 
shape of the mold but experiences some shrinkage. Casting techniques are employed 
when (1) the finished shape is so large or complicated that any other method would 
be impractical, (2) a particular alloy is so low in ductility that forming by either hot 
or cold working would be difficult, and (3) in comparison to other fabrication 
processes, casting is the most economical. Furthermore, the final step in the refin¬ 
ing of even ductile metals may involve a casting process. A number of different cast¬ 
ing techniques are commonly employed, including sand, die, investment, lost foam, 
and continuous casting. Only a cursory treatment of each of these is offered. 

Sand Casting 

With sand casting, probably the most common method, ordinary sand is used as the 
mold material. A two-piece mold is formed by packing sand around a pattern that 
has the shape of the intended casting. Furthermore, a gating system is usually in¬ 
corporated into the mold to expedite the flow of molten metal into the cavity and 
to minimize internal casting defects. Sand-cast parts include automotive cylinder 
blocks, fire hydrants, and large pipe fittings. 

Die Casting 

In die casting, the liquid metal is forced into a mold under pressure and at a rela¬ 
tively high velocity and allowed to solidify with the pressure maintained. A two- 
piece permanent steel mold or die is employed; when clamped together, the two 
pieces form the desired shape. When the metal has solidified completely, the die 
pieces are opened and the cast piece is ejected. Rapid casting rates are possible, 
making this an inexpensive method; furthermore, a single set of dies may be used 
for thousands of castings. However, this technique lends itself only to relatively small 
pieces and to alloys of zinc, aluminum, and magnesium, which have low melting 
temperatures. 

Investment Casting 

For investment (sometimes called lost-wax) casting, the pattern is made from a wax 
or plastic that has a low melting temperature. Around the pattern is poured a fluid 
slurry, which sets up to form a solid mold or investment; plaster of paris is usually 
used. The mold is then heated, such that the pattern melts and is burned out, leav¬ 
ing behind a mold cavity having the desired shape. This technique is employed when 
high dimensional accuracy, reproduction of fine detail, and an excellent finish are 
required—for example, in jewelry and dental crowns and inlays. Also, blades for gas 
turbines and jet engine impellers are investment cast. 


420 * Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 


Lost Foam Casting 

A variation of investment casting is lost foam (or expendable pattern ) casting. Here 
the expendable pattern is a foam that can be formed by compressing polystyrene 
beads into the desired shape and then bonding them together by heating. Alterna¬ 
tively, pattern shapes can be cut from sheets and assembled with glue. Sand is then 
packed around the pattern to form the mold. As the molten metal is poured into 
the mold, it replaces the pattern, which vaporizes. The compacted sand remains in 
place, and, upon solidification, the metal assumes the shape of the mold. 

With lost foam casting, complex geometries and tight tolerances are possible. 
Furthermore, in comparison to sand casting, lost foam is a simpler, quicker, and less 
expensive process, and there are fewer environmental wastes. Metal alloys that most 
commonly use this technique are cast irons and aluminum alloys; furthermore, 
applications include automobile engine blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, marine 
engine blocks, and electric motor frames. 

Continuous Casting 

At the conclusion of extraction processes, many molten metals are solidified by cast¬ 
ing into large ingot molds. The ingots are normally subjected to a primary hot-rolling 
operation, the product of which is a flat sheet or slab; these are more convenient 
shapes as starting points for subsequent secondary metal-forming operations (i.e., 
forging, extrusion, drawing). These casting and rolling steps may be combined by a 
continuous casting (sometimes also termed strand casting) process. Using this tech¬ 
nique, the refined and molten metal is cast directly into a continuous strand that 
may have either a rectangular or circular cross section; solidification occurs in a 
water-cooled die having the desired cross-sectional geometry. The chemical com¬ 
position and mechanical properties are more uniform throughout the cross sections 
for continuous castings than for ingot-cast products. Furthermore, continuous cast¬ 
ing is highly automated and more efficient. 


11.6 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNIQUES 

Powder Metallurgy 

Yet another fabrication technique involves the compaction of powdered metal, fol¬ 
lowed by a heat treatment to produce a more dense piece. The process is appro- 
powder metallurgy priately called powder metallurgy, frequently designated as P/M. Powder metallurgy 
makes it possible to produce a virtually nonporous piece having properties almost 
equivalent to the fully dense parent material. Diffusional processes during the heat 
treatment are central to the development of these properties. This method is espe¬ 
cially suitable for metals having low ductilities, because only small plastic defor¬ 
mation of the powder particles need occur. Metals with high melting temperatures 
are difficult to melt and cast, and fabrication is expedited using P/M. Furthermore, 
parts that require very close dimensional tolerances (e.g., bushings and gears) may 
be economically produced using this technique.

11.6 Miscellaneous Techniques * 421 


welding 


Welding 

In a sense, welding may be considered to be a fabrication technique. In welding, 
two or more metal parts are joined to form a single piece when one-part fabrica¬ 
tion is expensive or inconvenient. Both similar and dissimilar metals may be welded. 
The joining bond is metallurgical (involving some diffusion) rather than just me¬ 
chanical, as with riveting and bolting. A variety of welding methods exist, including 
arc and gas welding, as well as brazing and soldering. 

During arc and gas welding, the workpieces to be joined and the filler material 
(i.e., welding rod) are heated to a sufficiently high temperature to cause both to 
melt; upon solidification, the filler material forms a fusion joint between the work- 
pieces. Thus, there is a region adjacent to the weld that may have experienced mi- 
crostructural and property alterations; this region is termed the heat-affected zone 
(sometimes abbreviated HAZ). Possible alterations include the following: 

1. If the workpiece material was previously cold worked, this heat-affected zone 
may have experienced recrystallization and grain growth, and thus a dimin- 
ishment of strength, hardness, and toughness. The HAZ for this situation is 
represented schematically in Figure 11.9. 

2. Upon cooling, residual stresses may form in this region that weaken the joint. 

3. For steels, the material in this zone may have been heated to temperatures 
sufficiently high so as to form austenite. Upon cooling to room temperature, 
the microstructural products that form depend on cooling rate and alloy 
composition. For plain carbon steels, normally pearlite and a proeutectoid 
phase will be present. However, for alloy steels, one microstructural product 
may be martensite, which is ordinarily undesirable because it is so brittle. 

4. Some stainless steels may be “sensitized” during welding, which renders them 
susceptible to intergranular corrosion, as explained in Section 17.7. 

A relatively modern joining technique is that of laser beam welding, wherein a 
highly focused and intense laser beam is used as the heat source. The laser beam 
melts the parent metal, and, upon solidification, a fusion joint is produced; often a 
filler material need not be used. Some of the advantages of this technique are as 
follows: (1) it is a noncontact process, which eliminates mechanical distortion of the 
workpieces; (2) it can be rapid and highly automated; (3) energy input to the work- 
piece is low, and therefore the heat-affected zone size is minimal; (4) welds may be 
small in size and very precise; (5) a large variety of metals and alloys may be joined 
using this technique; and (6) porosity-free welds with strengths equal to or in

Thermal Processing of Metals 

Earlier chapters have discussed a number of phenomena that occur in metals and 
alloys at elevated temperatures—for example, recrystallization and the decomposi¬ 
tion of austenite. These are effective in altering the mechanical characteristics when 
appropriate heat treatments or thermal processes are employed. In fact, the use of 
heat treatments on commercial alloys is an exceedingly common practice. There¬ 
fore, we consider next the details of some of these processes, including annealing 
procedures, the heat treating of steels, and precipitation hardening. 

11.7 ANNEALING PROCESSES 

annealing The term annealing refers to a heat treatment in which a material is exposed to an 

elevated temperature for an extended time period and then slowly cooled. Ordi¬ 
narily, annealing is carried out to (1) relieve stresses; (2) increase softness, ductility, 
and toughness; and/or (3) produce a specific microstructure. A variety of annealing 
heat treatments are possible; they are characterized by the changes that are induced, 
which many times are microstructural and are responsible for the alteration of the 
mechanical properties. 

Any annealing process consists of three stages: (1) heating to the desired tem¬ 
perature, (2) holding or “soaking” at that temperature, and (3) cooling, usually to 
room temperature. Time is an important parameter in these procedures. During 
heating and cooling, temperature gradients exist between the outside and interior 
portions of the piece; their magnitudes depend on the size and geometry of the 
piece. If the rate of temperature change is too great, temperature gradients and in¬ 
ternal stresses may be induced that may lead to warping or even cracking. Also, the 
actual annealing time must be long enough to allow for any necessary transforma¬ 
tion reactions. Annealing temperature is also an important consideration; anneal¬ 
ing may be accelerated by increasing the temperature, because diffusional processes 
are normally involved. 

Process Annealing 

process annealing Process annealing is a heat treatment that is used to negate the effects of cold 
work—that is, to soften and increase the ductility of a previously strain-hardened 
metal. It is commonly utilized during fabrication procedures that require extensive 
plastic deformation, to allow a continuation of deformation without fracture or ex¬ 
cessive energy consumption. Recovery and recrystallization processes are allowed 
to occur. Ordinarily a fine-grained microstructure is desired, and therefore, the heat 
treatment is terminated before appreciable grain growth has occurred. Surface

oxidation or scaling may be prevented or minimized by annealing at a relatively 
low temperature (but above the recrystallization temperature) or in a nonoxidiz¬ 
ing atmosphere. 

Stress Relief 

Internal residual stresses may develop in metal pieces in response to the following: 
(1) plastic deformation processes such as machining and grinding; (2) nonuniform 
cooling of a piece that was processed or fabricated at an elevated temperature, such 
as a weld or a casting; and (3) a phase transformation that is induced upon cooling 
wherein parent and product phases have different densities. Distortion and warpage 
may result if these residual stresses are not removed. They may be eliminated by a 
stress relief annealing heat treatment in which the piece is heated to the recom¬ 
mended temperature, held there long enough to attain a uniform temperature, and 
finally cooled to room temperature in air. The annealing temperature is ordinarily 
a relatively low one such that effects resulting from cold working and other heat 
treatments are not affected. 

Annealing of Ferrous Alloys 

Several different annealing procedures are employed to enhance the properties of 
steel alloys. However, before they are discussed, some comment relative to the la¬ 
beling of phase boundaries is necessary. Figure 11.10 shows the portion of the 
iron-iron carbide phase diagram in the vicinity of the eutectoid. The horizontal line 
at the eutectoid temperature, conventionally labeled is termed the lower criti¬ 
cal temperature, below which, under equilibrium conditions, all austenite will have 
transformed into ferrite and cementite phases. The phase boundaries denoted as A 3 
and A cm represent the upper critical temperature lines for hypoeutectoid and hy- 
pereutectoid steels, respectively. For temperatures and compositions above these 
boundaries, only the austenite phase will prevail. As explained in Section 9.20, other 
alloying elements will shift the eutectoid and the positions of these phase bound¬ 
ary lines. 

Normalizing 

Steels that have been plastically deformed by, for example, a rolling operation, 
consist of grains of pearlite (and most likely a proeutectoid phase), which are

average grain size) and produce a more uniform and desirable size distribution; 
fine-grained pearlitic steels are tougher than coarse-grained ones. Normalizing is 
accomplished by heating at least 55°C (100°F) above the upper critical tempera¬ 
ture—that is, above A 3 for compositions less than the eutectoid (0.76 wt% C), and 
above A cm for compositions greater than the eutectoid as represented in Figure 
11.10. After sufficient time has been allowed for the alloy to completely transform 
to austenite—a procedure termed austenitizing— the treatment is terminated by 
cooling in air. A normalizing cooling curve is superimposed on the continuous cool¬ 
ing transformation diagram (Figure 10.26). 

Full Anneal 

A heat treatment known as full annealing is often utilized in low- and medium-carbon 
steels that will be machined or will experience extensive plastic deformation dur¬ 
ing a forming operation. In general, the alloy is treated by heating to a tempera¬ 
ture of about 50°C above the A 3 line (to form austenite) for compositions less than 
the eutectoid, or, for compositions in excess of the eutectoid, 50°C above the A 1 line 
(to form austenite and Fe 3 C phases), as noted in Figure 11.10. The alloy is then fur¬ 
nace cooled; that is, the heat-treating furnace is turned off and both furnace and 
steel cool to room temperature at the same rate, which takes several hours. The mi- 
crostructural product of this anneal is coarse pearlite (in addition to any proeutec- 
toid phase) that is relatively soft and ductile. The full-anneal cooling procedure (also 
shown in Figure 10.26) is time consuming; however, a microstructure having small 
grains and a uniform grain structure results. 

Spheroidizing 

Medium- and high-carbon steels having a microstructure containing even coarse 
pearlite may still be too hard to conveniently machine or plastically deform. These 
steels, and in fact any steel, may be heat-treated or annealed to develop the spher- 
oidite structure as described in Section 10.5. Spheroidized steels have a maximum 
softness and ductility and are easily machined or deformed. The spheroidizing heat 
treatment, during which there is a coalescence of the Fe 3 C to form the spheroid 
particles, can take place by several methods, as follows: 

• Heating the alloy at a temperature just below the eutectoid [line A x in 

Figure 11.10, or at about 700°C (1300°F)] in the a + Fe 3 C region of the phase 
diagram. If the precursor microstructure contains pearlite, spheroidizing times 
will ordinarily range between 15 and 25 h. 

• Heating to a temperature just above the eutectoid temperature, and then either 
cooling very slowly in the furnace, or holding at a temperature just below the 
eutectoid temperature. 

• Heating and cooling alternately within about ±50°C of the A 1 line of Figure 11.10. 

To some degree, the rate at which spheroidite forms depends on prior mi¬ 
crostructure. For example, it is slowest for pearlite, and the finer the pearlite, the 
more rapid the rate. Also, prior cold work increases the spheroidizing reaction rate. 

Still other annealing treatments are possible. For example, glasses are annealed, 
as outlined in Section 13.9, to remove residual internal stresses that render the 
material excessively weak. In addition, microstructural alterations and the attendant 


11.8 Heat Treatment of Steels * 425 


modification of mechanical properties of cast irons, as discussed in Section 11.2, 
result from what are in a sense annealing treatments. 

11.8 HEAT TREATMENT OF STEELS 

Conventional heat treatment procedures for producing martensitic steels ordinar¬ 
ily involve continuous and rapid cooling of an austenitized specimen in some type 
of quenching medium, such as water, oil, or air. The optimum properties of a steel 
that has been quenched and then tempered can be realized only if, during the 
quenching heat treatment, the specimen has been converted to a high content of 
martensite; the formation of any pearlite and/or bainite will result in other than the 
best combination of mechanical characteristics. During the quenching treatment, it 
is impossible to cool the specimen at a uniform rate throughout—the surface will 
always cool more rapidly than interior regions. Therefore, the austenite will trans¬ 
form over a range of temperatures, yielding a possible variation of microstructure 
and properties with position within a specimen. 

The successful heat treating of steels to produce a predominantly martensitic 
microstructure throughout the cross section depends mainly on three factors: (1) 
the composition of the alloy, (2) the type and character of the quenching medium, 
and (3) the size and shape of the specimen. The influence of each of these factors 
is now addressed. 

Hardenability 

The influence of alloy composition on the ability of a steel alloy to transform to 
martensite for a particular quenching treatment is related to a parameter called 

hardenability hardenability. For every different steel alloy there is a specific relationship between 

the mechanical properties and the cooling rate. Hardenability is a term that is used 
to describe the ability of an alloy to be hardened by the formation of martensite as 
a result of a given heat treatment. Hardenability is not “hardness,” which is the re¬ 
sistance to indentation; rather, hardenability is a qualitative measure of the rate at 
which hardness drops off with distance into the interior of a specimen as a result 
of diminished martensite content. A steel alloy that has a high hardenability is one 
that hardens, or forms martensite, not only at the surface but to a large degree 
throughout the entire interior. 

The Jominy End-Quench Test 

One standard procedure that is widely utilized to determine hardenability is the 

Jominy end-quench Jominy end-quench test. 1 With this procedure, except for alloy composition, all fac- 
test tors that may influence the depth to which a piece hardens (i.e., specimen size and 

shape, and quenching treatment) are maintained constant. A cylindrical specimen 
25.4 mm (1.0 in.) in diameter and 100 mm (4 in.) long is austenitized at a prescribed 
temperature for a prescribed time. After removal from the furnace, it is quickly 
mounted in a fixture as diagrammed in Figure 11.11 a. The lower end is quenched 
by a jet of water of specified flow rate and temperature. Thus, the cooling rate is a 
maximum at the quenched end and diminishes with position from this point along 
the length of the specimen. After the piece has cooled to room temperature, shallow 
flats 0.4 mm (0.015 in.) deep are ground along the specimen length and Rockwell 
hardness measurements are made for the first 50 mm (2 in.) along each flat 
(Figure 11.116); for the first 12.8 mm (| in.), hardness readings are taken at 1.6-mm

(^-in.) intervals, and for the remaining 38.4 mm (l| in.), every 3.2 mm (| in.). A 
hardenability curve is produced when hardness is plotted as a function of position 
from the quenched end. 

Hardenability Curves 

A typical hardenability curve is represented in Figure 11.12. The quenched end is 
cooled most rapidly and exhibits the maximum hardness; 100% martensite is the 
product at this position for most steels. Cooling rate decreases with distance from 
the quenched end, and the hardness also decreases, as indicated in the figure. With 
diminishing cooling rate, more time is allowed for carbon diffusion and the forma¬ 
tion of a greater proportion of the softer pearlite, which may be mixed with marten¬ 
site and bainite. Thus, a steel that is highly hardenable will retain large hardness 
values for relatively long distances; a steel with low hardenability will not. Also, 
each steel ahoy has its own unique hardenability curve. 

Sometimes, it is convenient to relate hardness to a cooling rate rather than to 
the location from the quenched end of a standard Jominy specimen. Cooling rate 
[taken at 700°C (1300°F)] is ordinarily shown on the upper horizontal axis of a 
hardenability diagram; this scale is included with the hardenability plots presented

here. This correlation between position and cooling rate is the same for plain 
carbon steels and many alloy steels because the rate of heat transfer is nearly 
independent of composition. On occasion, cooling rate or position from the 
quenched end is specified in terms of Jominy distance, one Jominy distance unit 
being 1.6 mm in.). 

A correlation may be drawn between position along the Jominy specimen and 
continuous cooling transformations. For example, Figure 11.13 is a continuous cool¬ 
ing transformation diagram for a eutectoid iron-carbon alloy onto which are su¬ 
perimposed the cooling curves at four different Jominy positions and correspon¬ 
ding microstructures that result for each. The hardenability curve for this alloy is 
also included. 

The hardenability curves for five different steel alloys all having 0.40 wt% C, 
yet differing amounts of other alloying elements, are shown in Figure 11.14. One 
specimen is a plain carbon steel (1040); the other four (4140,4340, 5140, and 8640) 
are alloy steels. The compositions of the four alloy steels are included with the fig¬ 
ure. The significance of the alloy designation numbers (e.g., 1040) is explained in 
Section 11.2. Several details are worth noting from this figure. First, all five alloys 
have identical hardnesses at the quenched end (57 HRC); this hardness is a func¬ 
tion of carbon content only, which is the same for all these alloys.

Figure 11.14 Hardenability curves for five different steel alloys, each containing 0.4 wt% 
C. Approximate alloy compositions (wt%) are as follows: 4340—1.85 Ni, 0.80 Cr, and 0.25 
Mo; 4140-1.0 Cr and 0.20 Mo; 8640-0.55 Ni, 0.50 Cr, and 0.20 Mo; 5140-0.85 Cr; and 
1040 is an unalloyed steel. (Adapted from figure furnished courtesy Republic Steel 
Corporation.) 


Probably the most significant feature of these curves is shape, which relates to 
hardenability. The hardenability of the plain carbon 1040 steel is low because the 
hardness drops off precipitously (to about 30 HRC) after a relatively short Jominy 
distance (6.4 mm, \ in.). By way of contrast, the decreases in hardness for the other 
four ahoy steels are distinctly more gradual. For example, at a Jominy distance of 50 
mm (2 in.), the hardnesses of the 4340 and 8640 alloys are approximately 50 and 32 
HRC, respectively; thus, of these two alloys, the 4340 is more hardenable. A water- 
quenched specimen of the 1040 plain carbon steel would harden only to a shallow 
depth below the surface, whereas for the other four ahoy steels the high quenched 
hardness would persist to a much greater depth. 

The hardness profiles in Figure 11.14 are indicative of the influence of cooling 
rate on the microstructure. At the quenched end, where the quenching rate is ap¬ 
proximately 600°C/s (1100°F/s), 100% martensite is present for ah five alloys. For 
cooling rates less than about 70°C/s (125°F/s) or Jominy distances greater than about 
6.4 mm in.), the microstructure of the 1040 steel is predominantly pearlitic, with 
some proeutectoid ferrite. However, the microstructures of the four ahoy steels con¬ 
sist primarily of a mixture of martensite and bainite; bainite content increases with 
decreasing cooling rate. 

This disparity in hardenability behavior for the five alloys in Figure 11.14 is 
explained by the presence of nickel, chromium, and molybdenum in the alloy steels. 
These alloying elements delay the austenite-to-pearlite and/or bainite reactions, as 
explained previously; this permits more martensite to form for a particular cool¬ 
ing rate, yielding a greater hardness. The right-hand axis of Figure 11.14 shows the

approximate percentage of martensite that is present at various hardnesses for 
these alloys. 

The hardenability curves also depend on carbon content. This effect is demon¬ 
strated in Figure 11.15 for a series of ahoy steels in which only the concentration 
of carbon is varied. The hardness at any Jominy position increases with the con¬ 
centration of carbon. 

Also, during the industrial production of steel, there is always a slight, un¬ 
avoidable variation in composition and average grain size from one batch to an¬ 
other. This variation results in some scatter in measured hardenability data, which 
frequently are plotted as a band representing the maximum and minimum val¬ 
ues that would be expected for the particular alloy. Such a hardenability band is 
plotted in Figure 11.16 for an 8640 steel. An H following the designation speci¬ 
fication for an alloy (e.g., 8640H) indicates that the composition and character¬ 
istics of the alloy are such that its hardenability curve will he within a specified 
band. 


Influence of Quenching Medium, Specimen 
Size, and Geometry 

The preceding treatment of hardenability discussed the influence of both alloy com¬ 
position and cooling or quenching rate on the hardness. The cooling rate of a spec¬ 
imen depends on the rate of heat energy extraction, which is a function of the 
characteristics of the quenching medium in contact with the specimen surface, as 
well as the specimen size and geometry.

Severity of quench is a term often used to indicate the rate of cooling; the more 
rapid the quench, the more severe the quench. Of the three most common quench¬ 
ing media—water, oil, and air—water produces the most severe quench, followed by 
oil, which is more effective than air. 2 The degree of agitation of each medium also 
influences the rate of heat removal. Increasing the velocity of the quenching medium 
across the specimen surface enhances the quenching effectiveness. Oil quenches are 
suitable for the heat treating of many alloy steels. In fact, for higher-carbon steels, 
a water quench is too severe because cracking and warping may be produced. Air 
cooling of austenitized plain carbon steels ordinarily produces an almost totally 
pearlitic structure. 

During the quenching of a steel specimen, heat energy must be transported to 
the surface before it can be dissipated into the quenching medium. As a conse¬ 
quence, the cooling rate within and throughout the interior of a steel structure 
varies with position and depends on the geometry and size. Figures 11.17a and 
11.176 show the quenching rate at 700°C (1300°F) as a function of diameter for 
cylindrical bars at four radial positions (surface, three-quarters radius, midradius, 
and center). Quenching is in mildly agitated water (Figure 11.17a) and oil (Figure 
11.176); cooling rate is also expressed as equivalent Jominy distance, because these 


2 Aqueous polymer quenchants {solutions composed of water and a polymer [normally 
poly(alkylene glycol) or PAG]} have recently been developed that provide quenching 
rates between those of water and oil. The quenching rate can be tailored to specific 
requirements by changing polymer concentration and quench bath temperature.

data are often used in conjunction with hardenability curves. Diagrams similar to 
those in Figure 11.17 have also been generated for geometries other than cylin¬ 
drical (e.g., flat plates). 

One utility of such diagrams is in the prediction of the hardness traverse along 
the cross section of a specimen. For example, Figure 11.18a compares the radial 
hardness distributions for cylindrical plain carbon (1040) and alloy (4140) steel 
specimens; both have a diameter of 50 mm (2 in.) and are water quenched. The 
difference in hardenability is evident from these two profiles. Specimen diameter 
also influences the hardness distribution, as demonstrated in Figure 11.18Z?, which 
plots the hardness profiles for oil-quenched 4140 cylinders 50 and 75 mm (2 and 
3 in.) in diameter. Example Problem 11.1 illustrates how these hardness profiles 
are determined. 

As far as specimen shape is concerned, because the heat energy is dissi¬ 
pated to the quenching medium at the specimen surface, the rate of cooling for 
a particular quenching treatment depends on the ratio of surface area to the 
mass of the specimen. The larger this ratio, the more rapid will be the cooling 
rate and, consequently, the deeper the hardening effect. Irregular shapes with 
edges and corners have larger surface-to-mass ratios than regular and rounded 
shapes (e.g., spheres and cylinders) and are thus more amenable to hardening 
by quenching.

A multitude of steels are responsive to a martensitic heat treatment, and one 
of the most important criteria in the selection process is hardenability. Harden- 
ability curves, when utilized in conjunction with plots such as those in Figure 
11.17 for various quenching media, may be used to ascertain the suitability of a 
specific steel alloy for a particular application. Or, conversely, the appropriate¬ 
ness of a quenching procedure for an alloy may be determined. For parts that 
are to be involved in relatively high stress applications, a minimum of 80% 
martensite must be produced throughout the interior as a consequence of the 
quenching procedure. Only a 50% minimum is required for moderately stressed 
parts.

drical specimen of 1040 steel that has been quenched in moderately agitated

Solution 

First, evaluate the cooling rate (in terms of the Jominy end-quench distance) 
at center, surface, mid-, and three-quarter radial positions of the cylindri¬ 
cal specimen. This is accomplished using the cooling rate-versus-bar di¬ 
ameter plot for the appropriate quenching medium, in this case, Figure 
11.17a. Then, convert the cooling rate at each of these radial positions into 
a hardness value from a hardenability plot for the particular alloy. Finally, 
determine the hardness profile by plotting the hardness as a function of 
radial position. 

This procedure is demonstrated in Figure 11.19, for the center position. 
Note that for a water-quenched cylinder of 50 mm (2 in.) diameter, the cool¬ 
ing rate at the center is equivalent to that approximately 9.5 mm (§ in.) from 
the Jominy specimen quenched end (Figure 11.19a). This corresponds to a 
hardness of about 28 HRC, as noted from the hardenability plot for the 1040 
steel alloy (Figure 11.196). Finally, this data point is plotted on the hardness 
profile in Figure 11.19c.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 11.1 


Steel Alloy and Heat Treatment Selection 

It is necessary to select a steel alloy for a gearbox output shaft. The design calls 
for a 1-in.-diameter cylindrical shaft having a surface hardness of at least 38 HRC 
and a minimum ductility of 12%EL. Specify an alloy and treatment that meet 
these criteria. 


Solution 

First of all, cost is also most likely an important design consideration. This would 
probably eliminate relatively expensive steels, such as stainless and those that 
are precipitation hardenable. Therefore, let us begin by examining plain carbon 
steels and low-alloy steels and what treatments are available to alter their me¬ 
chanical characteristics. 

It is unlikely that merely cold working one of these steels would produce the 
desired combination of hardness and ductility. For example, from Figure 6.19, a 
hardness of 38 HRC corresponds to a tensile strength of 1200 MPa (175,000 psi). 
The tensile strength as a function of percent cold work for a 1040 steel is repre¬ 
sented in Figure 7.195. Here it may be noted that at 50%CW, a tensile strength 
of only about 900 MPa (130,000 psi) is achieved; furthermore, the corresponding 
ductility is approximately 10%EL (Figure 7.19c). Hence, both of these proper¬ 
ties fall short of those specified in the design; furthermore, cold working other 
plain-carbon or low-alloy steels would probably not achieve the required mini¬ 
mum values. 

Another possibility is to perform a series of heat treatments in which the 
steel is austenitized, quenched (to form martensite), and finally tempered. Let 
us now examine the mechanical properties of various plain carbon steels and 
low-alloy steels that have been heat-treated in this manner. To begin, the surface 
hardness of the quenched material (which ultimately affects the tempered hard¬ 
ness) will depend on both alloy content and shaft diameter, as discussed in the 
previous two sections. For example, the degree to which surface hardness 
decreases with diameter is represented in Table 11.11 for a 1060 steel that was oil 
quenched. Furthermore, the tempered surface hardness will also depend on tem¬ 
pering temperature and time.

As-quenched and tempered hardness and ductility data were collected 
for one plain carbon steel (AISI/SAE 1040) and several common and read¬ 
ily available low-alloy steels, data for which are presented in Table 11.12. The 
quenching medium (either oil or water) is indicated, and tempering temper¬ 
atures were 540°C (1000°F), 595°C (1100°F), and 650°C (1200°F). As may be 
noted, the only alloy-heat treatment combinations that meet the stipulated 
criteria are 4150/oil-540°C temper, 4340/oil-540°C temper, and 6150/oil-540°C 
temper; data for these alloys/heat treatments are boldfaced in the table. The 
costs of these three materials are probably comparable; however, a cost analy¬ 
sis should be conducted. Furthermore, the 6150 alloy has the highest ductil¬ 
ity (by a narrow margin), which would give it a slight edge in the selection 
process.

a These hardness values are only approximate because they are less than 20 HRC. 



As the previous section notes, for cylindrical steel alloy specimens that have 
been quenched, surface hardness depends not only upon alloy composition and 
quenching medium, but also upon specimen diameter. Likewise, the mechanical 
characteristics of steel specimens that have been quenched and subsequently tem¬ 
pered will also be a function of specimen diameter. This phenomenon is illus¬ 
trated in Figure 11.20, which plots for an oil-quenched 4140 steel, tensile strength, 
yield strength, and ductility (%EL) versus tempering temperature for four 
diameters—12.5 mm (0.5 in.), 25 mm (1 in.), 50 mm (2 in.), and 100 mm (4 in.).

11.9 PRECIPITATION HARDENING 

The strength and hardness of some metal alloys may be enhanced by the for¬ 
mation of extremely small uniformly dispersed particles of a second phase within 
the original phase matrix; this must be accomplished by phase transformations

that are induced by appropriate heat treatments. The process is called precipitation 
hardening because the small particles of the new phase are termed precipitates. Age 
hardening is also used to designate this procedure because the strength develops 
with time, or as the alloy ages. Examples of alloys that are hardened by precipita¬ 
tion treatments include aluminum-copper, copper-beryllium, copper-tin, and 
magnesium-aluminum; some ferrous alloys are also precipitation hardenable. 

Precipitation hardening and the treating of steel to form tempered marten¬ 
site are totally different phenomena, even though the heat treatment procedures 
are similar; therefore, the processes should not be confused. The principal differ¬ 
ence lies in the mechanisms by which hardening and strengthening are achieved. 
These should become apparent as precipitation hardening is explained. 

Heat Treatments 

Inasmuch as precipitation hardening results from the development of particles of 
a new phase, an explanation of the heat treatment procedure is facilitated by use 
of a phase diagram. Even though, in practice, many precipitation-hardenable alloys 
contain two or more alloying elements, the discussion is simplified by reference to 
a binary system. The phase diagram must be of the form shown for the hypotheti¬ 
cal A-B system in Figure 11.21. 

Two requisite features must be displayed by the phase diagrams of alloy sys¬ 
tems for precipitation hardening: an appreciable maximum solubility of one com¬ 
ponent in the other, on the order of several percent; and a solubility limit that rapidly 
decreases in concentration of the major component with temperature reduction. 
Both of these conditions are satisfied by this hypothetical phase diagram (Fig¬ 
ure 11.21). The maximum solubility corresponds to the composition at point M. In 
addition, the solubility limit boundary between the a and a + /3 phase fields 
diminishes from this maximum concentration to a very low B content in A at point 
N. Furthermore, the composition of a precipitation-hardenable alloy must be less 
than the maximum solubility. These conditions are necessary but not sufficient for 
precipitation hardening to occur in an alloy system. An additional requirement is 
discussed below. 

Solution Heat Treating 

Precipitation hardening is accomplished by two different heat treatments. The first 
is a solution heat treatment in which all solute atoms are dissolved to form a single¬ 
phase solid solution. Consider an alloy of composition C 0 in Figure 11.21. The

treatment consists of heating the alloy to a temperature within the a phase field- 
say, T 0 — and waiting until all of the (3 phase that may have been present is com¬ 
pletely dissolved. At this point, the alloy consists only of an a phase of composition 
C 0 . This procedure is followed by rapid cooling or quenching to temperature 7\, 
which for many alloys is room temperature, to the extent that any diffusion and the 
accompanying formation of any of the (3 phase are prevented. Thus, a nonequilib¬ 
rium situation exists in which only the a-phase solid solution supersaturated with 
B atoms is present at 7\; in this state the alloy is relatively soft and weak. Further¬ 
more, for most alloys diffusion rates at T x are extremely slow, such that the single 
a phase is retained at this temperature for relatively long periods. 

Precipitation Heat Treating 

For the second or precipitation heat treatment, the supersaturated a solid solution 
is ordinarily heated to an intermediate temperature T 2 (Figure 11.21) within the a 
+ /3 two-phase region, at which temperature diffusion rates become appreciable. 
The /3 precipitate phase begins to form as finely dispersed particles of composi¬ 
tion Cp, which process is sometimes termed aging. After the appropriate aging time 
at T 2 , the alloy is cooled to room temperature; normally, this cooling rate is not an 
important consideration. Both solution and precipitation heat treatments are rep¬ 
resented on the temperature-versus-time plot, Figure 11.22. The character of these 
13 particles, and subsequently the strength and hardness of the alloy, depend on 
both the precipitation temperature T 2 and the aging time at this temperature. For 
some alloys, aging occurs spontaneously at room temperature over extended time 
periods. 

The dependence of the growth of the precipitate (3 particles on time and 
temperature under isothermal heat treatment conditions may be represented by 
C-shaped curves similar to those in Figure 10.18 for the eutectoid transforma¬ 
tion in steels. However, it is more useful and convenient to present the data as 
tensile strength, yield strength, or hardness at room temperature as a function 
of the logarithm of aging time, at constant temperature T 2 . The behavior for a 
typical precipitation-hardenable alloy is represented schematically in Fig¬ 
ure 11.23. With increasing time, the strength or hardness increases, reaches a 
maximum, and finally diminishes. This reduction in strength and hardness that 
occurs after long time periods is known as overaging. The influence of temper¬ 
ature is incorporated by the superposition, on a single plot, of curves at a vari¬ 
ety of temperatures.

Mechanism of Hardening 

Precipitation hardening is commonly employed with high-strength aluminum alloys. 
Although a large number of these alloys have different proportions and combina¬ 
tions of alloying elements, the mechanism of hardening has perhaps been studied 
most extensively for the aluminum-copper alloys. Figure 11.24 presents the 
aluminum-rich portion of the aluminum-copper phase diagram. The a phase is a sub¬ 
stitutional solid solution of copper in aluminum, whereas the intermetallic com¬ 
pound CuA 1 2 is designated the 6 phase. For an aluminum-copper alloy of, say, 
composition 96 wt% Al-4 wt% Cu, in the development of this equilibrium 6 phase 
during the precipitation heat treatment, several transition phases are first formed 
in a specific sequence. The mechanical properties are influenced by the character 
of the particles of these transition phases. During the initial hardening stage (at 
short times, Figure 11.23), copper atoms cluster together in very small and thin discs 
that are only one or two atoms thick and approximately 25 atoms in diameter; these 
form at countless positions within the a phase. The clusters, sometimes called zones, 
are so small that they are really not regarded as distinct precipitate particles. How¬ 
ever, with time and the subsequent diffusion of copper atoms, zones become parti¬ 
cles as they increase in size. These precipitate particles then pass through two

be preserved upon cooling the alloy to room temperature. Overaging results from 
continued particle growth and the development of 0' and 0 phases. 

The strengthening process is accelerated as the temperature is increased. This 
is demonstrated in Figure 11.27a, a plot of tensile strength versus the logarithm of 
time for a 2014 aluminum alloy at several different precipitation temperatures. Ide¬ 
ally, temperature and time for the precipitation heat treatment should be designed 
to produce a hardness or strength in the vicinity of the maximum. Associated with 
an increase in strength is a reduction in ductility, which is demonstrated in Figure 
11.277? for the same 2014 aluminum alloy at the several temperatures. 

Not all alloys that satisfy the aforementioned conditions relative to composi¬ 
tion and phase diagram configuration are amenable to precipitation hardening. In

addition, lattice strains must be established at the precipitate-matrix interface. For 
aluminum-copper alloys, there is a distortion of the crystal lattice structure around 
and within the vicinity of particles of these transition phases (Figure 11.25 b). Dur¬ 
ing plastic deformation, dislocation motions are effectively impeded as a result of 
these distortions, and, consequently, the alloy becomes harder and stronger. As the 
6 phase forms, the resultant overaging (softening and weakening) is explained by a 
reduction in the resistance to slip that is offered by these precipitate particles. 

Alloys that experience appreciable precipitation hardening at room tempera¬ 
ture and after relatively short time periods must be quenched to and stored under 
refrigerated conditions. Several aluminum alloys that are used for rivets exhibit this 
behavior. They are driven while still soft, then allowed to age harden at the normal 
natural aging, ambient temperature. This is termed natural aging; artificial aging is carried out at 

artificial aging elevated temperatures. 


Miscellaneous Considerations 

The combined effects of strain hardening and precipitation hardening may be em¬ 
ployed in high-strength alloys. The order of these hardening procedures is impor¬ 
tant in the production of alloys having the optimum combination of mechanical 















442 * Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 

properties. Normally, the alloy is solution heat-treated and then quenched. This is 
followed by cold working and finally by the precipitation-hardening heat treatment. 
In the final treatment, little strength loss is sustained as a result of recrystallization. 
If the alloy is precipitation hardened before cold working, more energy must be ex¬ 
pended in its deformation; in addition, cracking may also result because of the re¬ 
duction in ductility that accompanies the precipitation hardening. 

Most precipitation-hardened alloys are limited in their maximum service tem¬ 
peratures. Exposure to temperatures at which aging occurs may lead to a loss of 
strength due to overaging. 


SUMMARY 


Ferrous Alloys 

• Ferrous alloys (steels and cast irons) are those in which iron is the prime con¬ 
stituent. Most steels contain less than 1.0 wt% C, and, in addition, other alloying 
elements, which render them susceptible to heat treatment (and an enhancement 
of mechanical properties) and/or more corrosion resistant. 

• Ferrous alloys are used extensively as engineering materials because: 

Iron-bearing compounds are abundant. 

Economical extraction, refining, and fabrication techniques are available. 

They may be tailored to have a wide variety of mechanical and physical prop¬ 
erties. 

• Limitations of ferrous alloys include the following: 

Relatively high densities 

Comparatively low electrical conductivities 

Susceptibility to corrosion in common environments 

• The most common types of steels are plain low-carbon, high-strength low-alloy, 
medium-carbon, tool, and stainless. 

• Plain carbon steels contain (in addition to carbon) a little manganese and only 
residual concentrations of other impurities. 

• Stainless steels are classified according to the main microstructural constituent. 
The three classes are ferritic, austenitic, and martensitic. 

• Cast irons contain higher carbon contents than steels—normally between 3.0 and 
4.5 wt% C—as well as other alloying elements, notably silicon. For these materi¬ 
als, most of the carbon exists in graphite form rather than combined with iron as 
cementite. 

• Gray, ductile (or nodular), malleable, and compacted graphite irons are the four 
most widely used cast irons; the latter three are reasonably ductile. 

Nonferrous Alloys 

• All other alloys fall within the nonferrous category, which is further subdivided 
according to base metal or some distinctive characteristic that is shared by a group 
of alloys. 

• Nonferrous alloys may be further subclassified as either wrought or cast. Alloys 
that are amenable to forming by deformation are classified as wrought. Cast alloys 
are relatively brittle, and therefore fabrication by casting is most expedient. 

• Seven classifications of nonferrous alloys were discussed—copper, aluminum, 
magnesium, titanium, the refractory metals, the superalloys, and the noble met¬ 
als, as well as miscellaneous (nickel, lead, tin, zinc, and zirconium). 



Summary * 443 


Forming Operations 

• Forming operations are those in which a metal piece is shaped by plastic 
deformation. 

• When deformation is carried out above the recrystallization temperature, it is 
termed hot working; otherwise, it is cold working. 

• Forging, rolling, extrusion, and drawing are four of the more common forming 
techniques (Figure 11.8). 

Casting 

• Depending on the properties and shape of the finished piece, casting may be the 
most desirable and economical fabrication process. 

• The most common casting techniques are sand, die, investment, lost foam, and 
continuous. 

Miscellaneous Techniques 

• Powder metallurgy involves compacting powder metal particles into a desired 
shape, which is then densified by heat treatment. P/M is used primarily for met¬ 
als that have low ductilities and/or high melting temperatures. 

• Welding is used to join together two or more workpieces; a fusion bond forms 
by melting portions of the workpieces and, in some instances, a filler material. 

Annealing Processes 

• Exposure of a material to an elevated temperature for an extended time period fol¬ 
lowed by cooling to room temperature at a relatively slow rate is termed annealing. 

• During process annealing, a cold-worked piece is rendered softer yet more duc¬ 
tile as a consequence of recrystallization. 

• Internal residual stresses that have been introduced are eliminated during a stress- 
relief anneal. 

• For ferrous alloys, normalizing is used to refine and improve the grain structure. 

Heat Treatment of Steels 

• For high-strength steels, the best combination of mechanical characteristics may 
be realized if a predominantly martensitic microstructure is developed over the 
entire cross section; this is converted to tempered martensite during a tempering 
heat treatment. 

• Hardenability is a parameter used to ascertain the influence of composition on 
the susceptibility to the formation of a predominantly martensitic structure for 
some specific heat treatment. Martensite content is determined using hardness 
measurements. 

• Determination of hardenability is accomplished by the standard Jominy end- 
quench test (Figure 11.11), from which hardenability curves are generated. 

• A hardenability curve plots hardness versus distance from the quenched end of 
a Jominy specimen. Hardness decreases with distance from the quenched end 
(Figure 11.12) because the quenching rate decreases with this distance, as does 
also the martensite content. Each steel alloy has its own distinctive hardenabil¬ 
ity curve. 

• The quenching medium will also influence the extent to which martensite forms. 
Of the common quenching media, water is the most efficient, followed by aque¬ 
ous polymers, oil, and air, in that order. Increasing degree of medium agitation 
will also enhance the quenching efficiency. 


444 


Chapter 11 / Applications and Processing of Metal Alloys 


• Relationships between cooling rate and specimen size and geometry for a spe¬ 
cific quenching medium frequently are expressed on empirical charts (Figures 
11.17a and 11.176). These plots may be used in conjunction with hardenability 
data to predict cross-sectional hardness profiles (Example Problem 11.1). 

Precipitation Hardening 

• Some alloys are amenable to precipitation hardening—that is, to strengthening 
by the formation of very small particles of a second, or precipitate, phase. 

• Control of particle size, and subsequently strength, is accomplished by two heat 
treatments: 

In the first, or solution heat treatment, all solute atoms are dissolved to form 
a single-phase solid solution; quenching to a relatively low temperature 
preserves this state. 

During the second or precipitation treatment (at constant temperature), pre¬ 
cipitate particles form and grow; strength, hardness, and ductility are de¬ 
pendent on heat treating time (and particle size). 

• Strength and hardness increase with time to a maximum and then decrease dur¬ 
ing overaging (Figure 11.23). This process is accelerated with rising temperature 
(Figure 11.27a). 

• The strengthening phenomenon is explained in terms of an increased resistance 
to dislocation motion by lattice strains, which are established in the vicinity of 
these microscopically small precipitate particles. 

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

At this time, we have completed our processing/structure/properties/performance 
commentary for steels. By way of summary, Figure 11.28 shows relationships of these 
processing, structure, and property elements for this group of alloys. It was com¬ 
piled from summaries provided in previous chapters, and, in addition, includes top¬ 
ics discussed in this chapter. 

For the most part, the individual components found in the interrelationships of 
Figure 11.28 are conceptual in nature—that is, they represent the scientific (as 
opposed to engineering) aspects of materials. We have also generated a processing/ 
structure/properties/performance relational diagram (for steel alloys) taken from 
the materials engineering perspective; it is shown in Figure 11.29.

WHY STUDY Structures and Properties of Ceramics? 


Some of the properties of ceramics may be explained 
by their structures. For example: (a) The optical trans¬ 
parency of inorganic glass materials is due, in part, to 
their noncrystallinity; (b) the hydroplasticity of clays 
(i.e., development of plasticity upon the addition of 
water) is related to interactions between water mole¬ 
cules and the clay structures (Sections 12.3 and 13.10 
and Figure 12.14); and (c) the permanent magnetic 
and ferroelectric behaviors of some ceramic materials 
are explained by their crystal structures (Sections 20.5 
and 18.24). 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme, reasons for studying structures and properties 
of ceramics are as follows: 


• During the production of a glass-ceramic, a glass is 
formed that is subsequently transformed into a crys¬ 
talline solid (Chapter 13). We discuss in this chapter 
the structure of silica glasses. 

• One step in the fabrication of most glass-ceramics 
involves forming a semifluid mass into the desired 
shape. Thus, it is necessary to specify and quantify a 
property (i.e., viscosity) that represents a materiaI's 
resistance of mechanical deformation, which is also 
discussed in this chapter. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do 

1. Sketch/describe unit cells for sodium chloride, 
cesium chloride, zinc blende, diamond cubic, 
fluorite, and perovskite crystal structures. Do 
likewise for the atomic structures of graphite 
and a silica glass. 

2. Given the chemical formula for a ceramic com¬ 
pound and the ionic radii of its component ions, 
predict the crystal structure. 

3. Name and describe eight different ionic point 
defects that are found in ceramic compounds. 


the following: 

4. Briefly explain why there is normally significant 
scatter in the fracture strength for identical 
specimens of the same ceramic material. 

5. Compute the flexural strength of ceramic rod 
specimens that have been bent to fracture in 
three-point loading. 

6. On the basis of slip considerations, explain 
why crystalline ceramic materials are normally 
brittle. 


12.1 INTRODUCTION 

Ceramic materials were discussed briefly in Chapter 1, which noted that they are 
inorganic and nonmetallic materials. Most ceramics are compounds between metal¬ 
lic and nonmetallic elements for which the interatomic bonds are either totally ionic, 
or predominantly ionic but having some covalent character. The term ceramic comes 
from the Greek word keramikos, which means “burnt stuff,” indicating that desir¬ 
able properties of these materials are normally achieved through a high-temperature 
heat treatment process called firing. 

Up until the past 60 or so years, the most important materials in this class were 
termed the “traditional ceramics,” those for which the primary raw material is clay; 
products considered to be traditional ceramics are china, porcelain, bricks, tiles, and, 
in addition, glasses and high-temperature ceramics. Of late, significant progress has 
been made in understanding the fundamental character of these materials and of 
the phenomena that occur in them that are responsible for their unique properties. 


452 




12.2 Crystal Structures * 453 


Consequently, a new generation of these materials has evolved, and the term ce¬ 
ramic has taken on a much broader meaning. To one degree or another, these new 
materials have a rather dramatic effect on our lives; electronic, computer, commu¬ 
nication, aerospace, and a host of other industries rely on their use. 

This chapter discusses the types of crystal structure and atomic point defect 
that are found in ceramic materials and, in addition, some of their mechanical char¬ 
acteristics. Applications and fabrication techniques for this class of materials are 
treated in the next chapter. 


Ceramic Structures 


Because ceramics are composed of at least two elements, and often more, their 
crystal structures are generally more complex than those for metals. The atomic 
bonding in these materials ranges from purely ionic to totally covalent; many ceramics 
exhibit a combination of these two bonding types, the degree of ionic character 
being dependent on the electronegativities of the atoms. Table 12.1 presents the 
percent ionic character for several common ceramic materials; these values were 
determined using Equation 2.10 and the electronegativities in Figure 2.7. 


12.2 CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 

For those ceramic materials for which the atomic bonding is predominantly ionic, 
the crystal structures may be thought of as being composed of electrically charged 
cation ions instead of atoms. The metallic ions, or cations, are positively charged, because 

anion they have given up their valence electrons to the nonmetallic ions, or anions, which 

are negatively charged. Two characteristics of the component ions in crystalline ce¬ 
ramic materials influence the crystal structure: the magnitude of the electrical charge 
on each of the component ions, and the relative sizes of the cations and anions. With 
regard to the first characteristic, the crystal must be electrically neutral; that is, all 
the cation positive charges must be balanced by an equal number of anion nega¬ 
tive charges. The chemical formula of a compound indicates the ratio of cations to 
anions, or the composition that achieves this charge balance. For example, in calcium

fluoride, each calcium ion has a +2 charge (Ca 2+ ), and associated with each fluo¬ 
rine ion is a single negative charge (F _ ). Thus, there must be twice as many F - as 
Ca 2+ ions, which is reflected in the chemical formula CaF 2 . 

The second criterion involves the sizes or ionic radii of the cations and anions, 
r c and r A , respectively. Because the metallic elements give up electrons when ion¬ 
ized, cations are ordinarily smaller than anions, and, consequently, the ratio r c /r A is 
less than unity. Each cation prefers to have as many nearest-neighbor anions as pos¬ 
sible. The anions also desire a maximum number of cation nearest neighbors. 

Stable ceramic crystal structures form when those anions surrounding a cation 
are all in contact with that cation, as illustrated in Figure 12.1. The coordination 
number (i.e., number of anion nearest neighbors for a cation) is related to the 
cation-anion radius ratio. For a specific coordination number, there is a critical or 
minimum r c /r A ratio for which this cation-anion contact is established (Figure 12.1); 
this ratio may be determined from pure geometrical considerations (see Example 
Problem 12.1). 

The coordination numbers and nearest-neighbor geometries for various r c /r A 
ratios are presented in Table 12.2. For r c /r A ratios less than 0.155, the very small 
cation is bonded to two anions in a linear manner. If r c /r A has a value between 
0.155 and 0.225, the coordination number for the cation is 3. This means each cation 
is surrounded by three anions in the form of a planar equilateral triangle, with the 
cation located in the center. The coordination number is 4 for r c /r A between 0.225 
and 0.414; the cation is located at the center of a tetrahedron, with anions at each 
of the four corners. For r c /r A between 0.414 and 0.732, the cation may be thought 
of as being situated at the center of an octahedron surrounded by six anions, one 
at each corner, as also shown in the table. The coordination number is 8 for r c lr A 
between 0.732 and 1.0, with anions at all corners of a cube and a cation positioned 
at the center. For a radius ratio greater than unity, the coordination number is 12. 
The most common coordination numbers for ceramic materials are 4, 6, and 8. 
Table 12.3 gives the ionic radii for several anions and cations that are common in 
ceramic materials. 

The relationships between coordination number and cation-anion radii ratios 
(as noted in Table 12.2) are based on geometrical considerations and assuming “hard 
sphere” ions; therefore, these relationships are only approximate, and there are ex¬ 
ceptions. For example, some ceramic compounds with r c /r A ratios greater than 0.414 
in which the bonding is highly covalent (and directional) have a coordination num¬ 
ber of 4 (instead of 6). 

The size of an ion will depend on several factors. One of these is coordination 
number: ionic radius tends to increase as the number of nearest-neighbor ions of 
opposite charge increases. Ionic radii given in Table 12.3 are for a coordination num¬ 
ber of 6. Therefore, the radius will be greater for a coordination number of 8 and 
less when the coordination number is 4.

In addition, the charge on an ion will influence its radius. For example, from 
Table 12.3, the radii for Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ are 0.077 and 0.069 nm, respectively, which 
values may be contrasted to the radius of an iron atom—0.124 nm. When an elec¬ 
tron is removed from an atom or ion, the remaining valence electrons become more 
tightly bound to the nucleus, which results in a decrease in ionic radius. Conversely, 
ionic size increases when electrons are added to an atom or ion.

AX-Type Crystal Structures 

Some of the common ceramic materials are those in which there are equal num¬ 
bers of cations and anions. These are often referred to as AX compounds, where A 
denotes the cation and X the anion. There are several different crystal structures 
for AX compounds; each is normally named after a common material that assumes 
the particular structure. 


Rock Salt Structure 

Perhaps the most common AX crystal structure is the sodium chloride (NaCl), or 
rock salt, type. The coordination number for both cations and anions is 6, and there¬ 
fore the cation-anion radius ratio is between approximately 0.414 and 0.732. A unit 
cell for this crystal structure (Figure 12.2) is generated from an FCC arrangement 
of anions with one cation situated at the cube center and one at the center of each 
of the 12 cube edges. An equivalent crystal structure results from a face-centered 
arrangement of cations. Thus, the rock salt crystal structure may be thought of as 
two interpenetrating FCC lattices, one composed of the cations, the other of anions. 
Some of the common ceramic materials that form with this crystal structure are 
NaCl, MgO, MnS, LiF, and FeO.

chloride (NaCl), crystal structure.

Cesium Chloride Structure 


VMSE 



Figure 12.3 shows a unit cell for the cesium chloride (CsCl) crystal structure; the 
coordination number is 8 for both ion types. The anions are located at each of the 
corners of a cube, whereas the cube center is a single cation. Interchange of anions 
with cations, and vice versa, produces the same crystal structure. This is not a BCC 
crystal structure because ions of two different kinds are involved. 


Zinc Blende Structure 


VMSE 



A third AX structure is one in which the coordination number is 4; that is, all ions 
are tetrahedrally coordinated. This is called the zinc blende, or sphalerite, struc¬ 
ture, after the mineralogical term for zinc sulfide (ZnS). A unit cell is presented in 
Figure 12.4; all corner and face positions of the cubic cell are occupied by S atoms, 
whereas the Zn atoms fill interior tetrahedral positions. An equivalent structure 
results if Zn and S atom positions are reversed. Thus, each Zn atom is bonded to 
four S atoms, and vice versa. Most often the atomic bonding is highly covalent in 
compounds exhibiting this crystal structure (Table 12.1), which include ZnS, ZnTe, 
and SiC. 


A m X p -Type Crystal Structures 

If the charges on the cations and anions are not the same, a compound can exist 
with the chemical formula A m X p , where m and/or p ^ 1. An example would be AX 2 ,

for which a common crystal structure is found in fluorite (CaF 2 ).The ionic radii ra¬ 
tio r c /r A for CaF 2 is about 0.8, which, according to Table 12.2, gives a coordination 
number of 8. Calcium ions are positioned at the centers of cubes, with fluorine ions 
at the corners. The chemical formula shows that there are only half as many Ca 2+ 
ions as F - ions, and therefore the crystal structure would be similar to CsCl (Fig¬ 
ure 12.3), except that only half the center cube positions are occupied by Ca 2+ ions. 
One unit cell consists of eight cubes, as indicated in Figure 12.5. Other compounds 
that have this crystal structure include Zr0 2 (cubic), U0 2 , Pu0 2 , and Th0 2 . 


VMSE 



A m B n X p -Type Crystal Structures 

It is also possible for ceramic compounds to have more than one type of cation; for 
two types of cations (represented by A and B), their chemical formula may be des¬ 
ignated as A m B n X p . Barium titanate (BaTiO s ), having both Ba 2+ and Ti 4+ cations, 
falls into this classification. This material has a perovskite crystal structure and rather 
interesting electromechanical properties to be discussed later. At temperatures 
above 120°C (248°F), the crystal structure is cubic. A unit cell of this structure is 
shown in Figure 12.6; Ba 2+ ions are situated at all eight corners of the cube and a 
single Ti 4+ is at the cube center, with O 2- ions located at the center of each of the 
six faces.

Table 12.4 summarizes the rock salt, cesium chloride, zinc blende, fluorite, and 
perovskite crystal structures in terms of cation-anion ratios and coordination num¬ 
bers, and gives examples for each. Of course, many other ceramic crystal structures

Crystal Structures from the Close Packing of Anions 

It may be recalled (Section 3.12) that for metals, close-packed planes of atoms 
stacked on one another generate both FCC and HCP crystal structures. Simi¬ 
larly, a number of ceramic crystal structures may be considered in terms of 
close-packed planes of ions, as well as unit cells. Ordinarily, the close-packed 
planes are composed of the large anions. As these planes are stacked atop each 
other, small interstitial sites are created between them in which the cations may 
reside. 

These interstitial positions exist in two different types, as illustrated in Figure 
12.7. Four atoms (three in one plane, and a single one in the adjacent plane) sur¬ 
round one type; this is termed a tetrahedral position, because straight lines drawn 
from the centers of the surrounding spheres form a four-sided tetrahedron. The 
other site type in Figure 12.7 involves six ion spheres, three in each of the two 
planes. Because an octahedron is produced by joining these six sphere centers, 
this site is called an octahedral position. Thus, the coordination numbers for 
cations filling tetrahedral and octahedral positions are 4 and 6, respectively. Fur¬ 
thermore, for each of these anion spheres, one octahedral and two tetrahedral po¬ 
sitions will exist. 

Ceramic crystal structures of this type depend on two factors: (1) the stacking 
of the close-packed anion layers (both FCC and HCP arrangements are possible, 
which correspond to ABCABC ... and ABABAB ... sequences, respectively), and 
(2) the manner in which the interstitial sites are filled with cations. For example, 
consider the rock salt crystal structure discussed earlier. The unit cell has cubic 
symmetry, and each cation (Na + ion) has six Cl - ion nearest neighbors, as may be 
verified from Figure 12.2. That is, the Na + ion at the center has as nearest neigh¬ 
bors the six Cl - ions that reside at the centers of each of the cube faces. The 
crystal structure, having cubic symmetry, may be considered in terms of an FCC

array of close-packed planes of anions, and all planes are of the {111} type. The 
cations reside in octahedral positions because they have as nearest neighbors six 
anions. Furthermore, all octahedral positions are filled, because there is a single oc¬ 
tahedral site per anion, and the ratio of anions to cations is 1:1. For this crystal struc¬ 
ture, the relationship between the unit cell and close-packed anion plane stacking 
schemes is illustrated in Figure 12.8. 

Other, but not all, ceramic crystal structures may be treated in a similar man¬ 
ner; included are the zinc blende and perovskite structures. The spinel structure is 
one of the A m B n X p types, which is found for magnesium aluminate or spinel 
(MgAl 2 0 4 ). With this structure, the O 2- ions form an FCC lattice, whereas Mg 2+ 
ions fill tetrahedral sites and Al 3+ ions reside in octahedral positions. Magnetic ce¬ 
ramics, or ferrites, have a crystal structure that is a slight variant of this spinel struc¬ 
ture, and the magnetic characteristics are affected by the occupancy of tetrahedral 
and octahedral positions (see Section 20.5).

crystal structure from which a corner has

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.2 


Ceramic Crystal Structure Prediction 

On the basis of ionic radii (Table 12.3), what crystal structure would you pre¬ 
dict for FeO? 


Solution 

First, note that FeO is an AX-type compound. Next, determine the cation- 
anion radius ratio, which from Table 12.3 is 


r F e 2 + 


ro 2 - 


0.077 nm 
0.140 nm 


0.550 


This value lies between 0.414 and 0.732, and, therefore, from Table 12.2 the 
coordination number for the Fe 2+ ion is 6; this is also the coordination num¬ 
ber of O 2- , because there are equal numbers of cations and anions. The pre¬ 
dicted crystal structure will be rock salt, which is the AX crystal structure 
having a coordination number of 6, as given in Table 12.4. 



Check 12.1 


Table 12.3 gives the ionic radii for K + and O 2- as 0.138 and 0.140 nm, respectively.

Ceramic Density Computations 

It is possible to compute the theoretical density of a crystalline ceramic material 
from unit cell data in a manner similar to that described in Section 3.5 for metals. 
In this case the density p may be determined using a modified form of Equation 
3.5, as follows: 

Theoretical density 
for ceramic materials 


n'^A c + SA a ) 

V c N a 


( 12 . 1 ) 


where 


n' = the number of formula units 1 within the unit cell 
2A C = the sum of the atomic weights of all cations in the formula unit 
2 A a = the sum of the atomic weights of all anions in the formula unit 
V c = the unit cell volume 

N a = Avogadro’s number, 6.022 X 10 23 formula units/mol 


1 By “formula unit” we mean all the ions that are included in the chemical formula unit. 
For example, for BaTi0 3 , a formula unit consists of one barium ion, a titanium ion, and 
three oxygen ions.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.3 

Theoretical Density Calculation for Sodium Chloride 

On the basis of crystal structure, compute the theoretical density for sodium 
chloride. How does this compare with its measured density? 

Solution 

The theoretical density may be determined using Equation 12.1 where n ', the 
number of NaCl units per unit cell, is 4 because both sodium and chloride ions 
form FCC lattices. Furthermore, 

2^4 C ^.Na = 22.99 g/mol 
2^4 a = A a = 35.45 g/mol 

Because the unit cell is cubic, V c = a 3 , a being the unit cell edge length. For 
the face of the cubic unit cell shown in the accompanying figure, 

cl = 2 r Na + + 2r cl 

r Na + and r cl being the sodium and chlorine ionic radii, given in Table 12.3 as 
0.102 and 0.181 nm, respectively. 


^2(r Na + +

= 2.14 g/cm 3 

This result compares very favorably with the experimental value of 2.16 g/cm 3 .

12.3 SILICATE CERAMICS 

Silicates are materials composed primarily of silicon and oxygen, the two most abun¬ 
dant elements in the earth’s crust; consequently, the bulk of soils, rocks, clays, and 
sand come under the silicate classification. Rather than characterizing the crystal 
structures of these materials in terms of unit cells, it is more convenient to use var¬ 
ious arrangements of an SiO^ - tetrahedron (Figure 12.9). Each atom of silicon is 
bonded to four oxygen atoms, which are situated at the corners of the tetrahedron; 
the silicon atom is positioned at the center. Because this is the basic unit of the 
silicates, it is often treated as a negatively charged entity. 

Often the silicates are not considered to be ionic because there is a significant 
covalent character to the interatomic Si-O bonds (Table 12.1), which are directional 
and relatively strong. Regardless of the character of the Si-O bond, there is a for¬ 
mal charge of -4 associated with every SiO^ - tetrahedron, because each of the four 
oxygen atoms requires an extra electron to achieve a stable electronic structure. 
Various silicate structures arise from the different ways in which the SiO^ - units 
can be combined into one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrangements. 

Silica 

Chemically, the most simple silicate material is silicon dioxide, or silica (Si0 2 ). 
Structurally, it is a three-dimensional network that is generated when the corner 
oxygen atoms in each tetrahedron are shared by adjacent tetrahedra. Thus, the ma¬ 
terial is electrically neutral and all atoms have stable electronic structures. Under 
these circumstances the ratio of Si to O atoms is 1:2, as indicated by the chemical 
formula. 

If these tetrahedra are arrayed in a regular and ordered manner, a crystalline 
structure is formed. There are three primary polymorphic crystalline forms of silica: 
quartz, cristobalite (Figure 12.10), and tridymite. Their structures are relatively com¬ 
plicated, and comparatively open; that is, the atoms are not closely packed together. 
As a consequence, these crystalline silicas have relatively low densities; for exam¬ 
ple, at room temperature quartz has a density of only 2.65 g/cm 3 . The strength of 
the Si-O interatomic bonds is reflected in a relatively high melting temperature, 
1710°C (3110°F). 

Silica Glasses 

Silica can also be made to exist as a noncrystalline solid or glass having a high de¬ 
gree of atomic randomness, which is characteristic of the liquid; such a material is 
called fused silica, or vitreous silica. As with crystalline silica, the SiO^ - tetrahedron 
is the basic unit; beyond this structure, considerable disorder exists. The structures 





12.3 Silicate Ceramics * 465 



for crystalline and noncrystalline silica are compared schematically in Figure 3.23. 
Other oxides (e.g., B 2 O s and Ge0 2 ) may also form glassy structures (and polyhedral 
oxide structures similar to that shown in Figure 12.9); these materials, as well as 
Si0 2 , are termed network formers. 

The common inorganic glasses that are used for containers, windows, and so 
on are silica glasses to which have been added other oxides such as CaO and 
Na 2 0. These oxides do not form polyhedral networks. Rather, their cations are in¬ 
corporated within and modify the SiO^ - network; for this reason, these oxide ad¬ 
ditives are termed network modifiers. For example, Figure 12.11 is a schematic 
representation of the structure of a sodium-silicate glass. Still other oxides, such 
as Ti0 2 and A1 2 0 3 , though not network formers, substitute for silicon and become 
part of and stabilize the network; these are called intermediates. From a practical 
perspective, the addition of these modifiers and intermediates lowers the melting 
point and viscosity of a glass and makes it easier to form at lower temperatures 
(Section 13.9).

silicate ion structures

tetrahedra. 


The Silicates 

For the various silicate minerals, one, two, or three of the corner oxygen atoms of 
the Si0 4 _ tetrahedra are shared by other tetrahedra to form some rather complex 
structures. Some of these, represented in Figure 12.12, have formulas Si0 4 _ , Si 2 0 7 , 
Si 3 OcT and so on; single-chain structures are also possible, as in Figure 12.12c. Pos¬ 
itively charged cations such as Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , and Al 3+ serve two roles. First, they com¬ 
pensate the negative charges from the Si0 4 _ units so that charge neutrality is 
achieved; second, these cations ionically bond the Si0 4 _ tetrahedra together. 

Simple Silicates 

Of these silicates, the most structurally simple ones involve isolated tetrahedra (Fig¬ 
ure 12.12a). For example, forsterite (Mg 2 Si0 4 ) has the equivalent of two Mg 2+ ions 
associated with each tetrahedron in such a way that every Mg 2+ ion has six oxygen 
nearest neighbors. 

The Si 2 0 7 _ ion is formed when two tetrahedra share a common oxygen atom 
(Figure 12.126). Akermanite (Ca 2 MgSi 2 0 7 ) is a mineral having the equivalent of 
two Ca 2+ ions and one Mg 2+ ion bonded to each Si 2 0 7 _ unit. 

Layered Silicates 

A two-dimensional sheet or layered structure can also be produced by the sharing 
of three oxygen ions in each of the tetrahedra (Figure 12.13); for this structure the 
repeating unit formula may be represented by (Si 2 0 5 ) 2- . The net negative charge is 
associated with the unbonded oxygen atoms projecting out of the plane of the page. 
Electroneutrality is ordinarily established by a second planar sheet structure having 
an excess of cations, which bond to these unbonded oxygen atoms from the Si 2 0 5 
sheet. Such materials are called the sheet or layered silicates, and their basic struc¬ 
ture is characteristic of the clays and other minerals. 

One of the most common clay minerals, kaolinite, has a relatively simple two- 
layer silicate sheet structure. Kaolinite clay has the formula Al 2 (Si 2 0 5 )(0H) 4 in 
which the silica tetrahedral layer, represented by (Si 2 0 5 ) 2- , is made electrically neu¬ 
tral by an adjacent Al 2 (OH) 4 + layer. A single sheet of this structure is shown in

Figure 12.14, which is exploded in the vertical direction to provide a better per¬ 
spective of the ion positions; the two distinct layers are indicated in the figure. The 
midplane of anions consists of O 2- ions from the (Si 2 0 5 ) 2- layer, as well as OH - 
ions that are a part of the Al 2 (OH) 4 + layer. Whereas the bonding within this two¬ 
layered sheet is strong and intermediate ionic-covalent, adjacent sheets are only 
loosely bound to one another by weak van der Waals forces. 

A crystal of kaolinite is made of a series of these double layers or sheets stacked 
parallel to each other, which form small flat plates typically less than 1 p,m in 
diameter and nearly hexagonal. 

These silicate sheet structures are not confined to the clays; other minerals 
also in this group are talc [Mg 3 (Si 2 0 5 ) 2 (0H) 2 ] and the micas [e.g., muscovite, 
KAl 3 Si 3 O 10 (OH) 2 ], which are important ceramic raw materials. As might be deduced

from the chemical formulas, the structures for some silicates are among the most 
complex of all the inorganic materials. 


12.4 CARBON 

Carbon is an element that exists in various polymorphic forms, as well as in the 
amorphous state. This group of materials does not really fall within any one of 
the traditional metal, ceramic, or polymer classification schemes. However, we 
choose to discuss these materials in this chapter because graphite, one of the poly¬ 
morphic forms, is sometimes classified as a ceramic, and the crystal structure of 
diamond, another polymorph, is similar to that of zinc blende, discussed in Sec¬ 
tion 12.2. Treatment of the carbon materials will focus on the structures and char¬ 
acteristics of graphite, diamond, the fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes and on their 
current and potential uses. 

Diamond 

VMSE Diamond is a metastable carbon polymorph at room temperature and atmospheric 

QO) pressure. Its crystal structure is a variant of the zinc blende, in which carbon atoms 

occupy all positions (both Zn and S), as indicated in the unit cell shown in Figure 
12.15. Thus, each carbon bonds to four other carbons, and these bonds are totally 
covalent. This is appropriately called the diamond cubic crystal structure, which is 
also found for other Group IVA elements in the periodic table [e.g., germanium, 
silicon, and gray tin, below 13°C (55°F)]. 

The physical properties of diamond make it an extremely attractive material. 
It is extremely hard (the hardest known material) and has a very low electrical con¬ 
ductivity; these characteristics are due to its crystal structure and the strong inter¬ 
atomic covalent bonds. Furthermore, it has an unusually high thermal conductivity 
for a nonmetallic material, is optically transparent in the visible and infrared re¬ 
gions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and has a high index of refraction. Rela¬ 
tively large diamond single crystals are used as gemstones. Industrially, diamonds 
are utilized to grind or cut other softer materials (Section 13.6). Techniques to pro¬ 
duce synthetic diamonds have been developed, beginning in the mid-1950s, that 
have been refined to the degree that today a large proportion of the industrial-quality 
materials are synthetic, in addition to some of those of gem quality. 

Over the last several years, diamond in the form of thin films has been pro¬ 
duced. Film growth techniques involve vapor-phase chemical reactions followed by 
the film deposition. Maximum film thicknesses are on the order of a millimeter.

Furthermore, none of the films yet produced has the long-range crystalline regu¬ 
larity of natural diamond. The diamond is polycrystalline and may consist of very 
small and/or relatively large grains; in addition, amorphous carbon and graphite 
may be present. A scanning electron micrograph of the surface of a diamond thin 
film is shown in Figure 12.16. The mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of 
diamond films approach those of the bulk diamond material. These desirable prop¬ 
erties have been and will continue to be exploited so as to create new and better 
products. For example, the surfaces of drills, dies, bearings, knives, and other tools 
have been coated with diamond films to increase surface hardness; some lenses and 
radomes have been made stronger while remaining transparent by the application 
of diamond coatings; coatings have also been applied to loudspeaker tweeters and 
to high-precision micrometers. Potential applications for these films include appli¬ 
cation to the surface of machine components such as gears, to optical recording 
heads and disks, and as substrates for semiconductor devices. 


Graphite 


Another polymorph of carbon is graphite; it has a crystal structure (Figure 12.17) 
distinctly different from that of diamond and is also more stable than diamond at 


^ _-o2 ~ ~ _oL ~ Carbon 


Figure 12.17 The structure of graphite. 




































470 * Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics 


VMSE ambient temperature and pressure. The graphite structure is composed of layers of 
hexagonally arranged carbon atoms; within the layers, each carbon atom is bonded 
to three coplanar neighbor atoms by strong covalent bonds. The fourth bonding elec¬ 
tron participates in a weak van der Waals type of bond between the layers. As a con¬ 
sequence of these weak interplanar bonds, interplanar cleavage is facile, which gives 
rise to the excellent lubricative properties of graphite. Also, the electrical conduc¬ 
tivity is relatively high in crystallographic directions parallel to the hexagonal sheets. 

Other desirable properties of graphite include the following: high strength and 
good chemical stability at elevated temperatures and in nonoxidizing atmospheres, 
high thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion and high resistance 
to thermal shock, high adsorption of gases, and good machinability. Graphite is com¬ 
monly used as heating elements for electric furnaces; as electrodes for arc welding; 
in metallurgical crucibles; in casting molds for metal alloys and ceramics; for high- 
temperature refractories and insulations; in rocket nozzles; in chemical reactor ves¬ 
sels; for electrical contacts, brushes, and resistors; as electrodes in batteries; and in 
air purification devices. 

Fullerenes 

Another polymorphic form of carbon was discovered in 1985. It exists in discrete 
molecular form and consists of a hollow spherical cluster of sixty carbon atoms; a 
single molecule is denoted by C 60 . Each molecule is composed of groups of carbon 
atoms that are bonded to one another to form both hexagon (six-carbon atom) and 
pentagon (five-carbon atom) geometrical configurations. One such molecule, shown 
in Figure 12.18, is found to consist of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons, which are ar¬ 
rayed such that no two pentagons share a common side; the molecular surface thus 
exhibits the symmetry of a soccer ball. The material composed of C 60 molecules is 
known as buckminsterfullerene, named in honor of R. Buckminster Fuller, who in¬ 
vented the geodesic dome; each C 60 is simply a molecular replica of such a dome, 
which is often referred to as a “buckyball” for short. The term fullerene is used to 
denote the class of materials that are composed of this type of molecule. 

Diamond and graphite are what may be termed network solids, in that all of 
the carbon atoms form primary bonds with adjacent atoms throughout the entirety 
of the solid. By way of contrast, the carbon atoms in buckminsterfullerene bond to¬ 
gether so as to form these spherical molecules. In the solid state, the C 60 units form 
a crystalline structure and pack together in a face-centered cubic array. 

As a pure crystalline solid, this material is electrically insulating. However, with 
proper impurity additions, it can be made highly conductive and semiconductive.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Carbon Nanotubes 


A nother molecular form of carbon has recently 
been discovered that has some unique and 
technologically promising properties. Its structure 
consists of a single sheet of graphite, rolled into a 
tube, both ends of which are capped with C 60 
fullerene hemispheres. This carbon nanotube is 
represented schematically in Figure 12.19. The 
nano prefix denotes that tube diameters are on the 
order of a nanometer (i.e., 100 nm or less). Each 
nanotube is a single molecule composed of mil¬ 
lions of atoms; the length of this molecule is much 
greater (on the order of thousands of times 
greater) than its diameter. Multiple-walled carbon 
nanotubes consisting of concentric cylinders have 
also been found to exist. 

These nanotubes are extremely strong and 
stiff and relatively ductile. For single-walled nan¬ 
otubes, tensile strengths range between 50 and 
200 GPa (approximately an order of magnitude 
greater than for carbon fibers); this is the strongest 
known material. Elastic modulus values are on the 
order of one tetrapascal [TPa (1 TPa = 10 3 GPa)], 
with fracture strains between about 5% and 20%. 
Furthermore, nanotubes have relatively low den¬ 
sities. On the basis of these properties, the carbon 
nanotube has been termed the “ultimate fiber” 
and is extremely promising as a reinforcement in 
composite materials. 

Carbon nanotubes also have unique and 
structure-sensitive electrical characteristics. De¬ 
pending on the orientation of the hexagonal units 
in the graphene plane (i.e., tube wall) with the tube 
axis, the nanotube may behave electrically as 


either a metal or a semiconductor. It has been 
reported that flat-panel and full-color displays (i.e., 
TV and computer monitors) have been fabricated 
using carbon nanotubes as field emitters; these 
displays should be cheaper to produce and will 
have lower power requirements than CRT and 
liquid crystal displays. Furthermore, it is antici¬ 
pated that future electronic applications of carbon 
nanotubes will include diodes and transistors.

Atomic Point Defects 

Atomic defects involving host atoms may exist in ceramic compounds. As with 
metals, both vacancies and interstitials are possible; however, because ceramic 
materials contain ions of at least two kinds, defects for each ion type may occur. 
For example, in NaCl, Na interstitials and vacancies and Cl interstitials and 
vacancies may exist. It is highly improbable that there would be appreciable 
concentrations of anion interstitials. The anion is relatively large, and to fit into 
a small interstitial position, substantial strains on the surrounding ions must be 
introduced. Anion and cation vacancies and a cation interstitial are represented 
in Figure 12.20. 

The expression defect structure is often used to designate the types and con¬ 
centrations of atomic defects in ceramics. Because the atoms exist as charged ions, 
when defect structures are considered, conditions of electroneutrality must be main¬ 
tained. Electroneutrality is the state that exists when there are equal numbers of 
positive and negative charges from the ions. As a consequence, defects in ceramics 
do not occur alone. One such type of defect involves a cation-vacancy and a 
cation-interstitial pair. This is called a Frenkel defect (Figure 12.21). It might be 
thought of as being formed by a cation leaving its normal position and moving into 
an interstitial site. There is no change in charge because the cation maintains the 
same positive charge as an interstitial. 

Another type of defect found in AX materials is a cation vacancy-anion va¬ 
cancy pair known as a Schottky defect, also schematically diagrammed in Figure 
12.21. This defect might be thought of as being created by removing one cation and 
one anion from the interior of the crystal and then placing them both at an exter¬ 
nal surface. Because both cations and anions have the same charge, and because for 
every anion vacancy there exists a cation vacancy, the charge neutrality of the crys¬ 
tal is maintained. 

The ratio of cations to anions is not altered by the formation of either a Frenkel 
or a Schottky defect. If no other defects are present, the material is said to be sto¬ 
ichiometric. Stoichiometry may be defined as a state for ionic compounds wherein 
there is the exact ratio of cations to anions as predicted by the chemical formula. 
For example, NaCl is stoichiometric if the ratio of Na + ions to CPions is exactly

1:1. A ceramic compound is nonstoichiometric if there is any deviation from this 
exact ratio. 

Nonstoichiometry may occur for some ceramic materials in which two valence 
(or ionic) states exist for one of the ion types. Iron oxide (wiistite, FeO) is one such 
material, because the iron can be present in both Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ states; the number 
of each of these ion types depends on temperature and the ambient oxygen pres¬ 
sure. The formation of an Fe 3+ ion disrupts the electroneutrality of the crystal by 
introducing an excess +1 charge, which must be offset by some type of defect. This 
may be accomplished by the formation of one Fe 2+ vacancy (or the removal of two 
positive charges) for every two Fe 3+ ions that are formed (Figure 12.22). The crys¬ 
tal is no longer stoichiometric because there is one more O ion than Fe ion; how¬ 
ever, the crystal remains electrically neutral. This phenomenon is fairly common in 
iron oxide, and, in fact, its chemical formula is often written as Fe t _ A 0 (where x is 
some small and variable fraction substantially less than unity) to indicate a condi¬ 
tion of nonstoichiometry with a deficiency of Fe.

The equilibrium numbers of both Frenkel and Schottky defects increase with and 
depend on temperature in a manner similar to the number of vacancies in metals 
(Equation 4.1). For Frenkel defects, the number of cation-vacancy/cation- interstitial 
defect pairs (N fr ) depends on temperature according to the following expression: 

N fr = Nex p(~ 2kr) (12 - 2) 

Here Q fr is the energy required for the formation of each Frenkel defect, and N is 
the total number of lattice sites. (Also, as in previous discussions, k and T represent 
Boltzmann’s constant and the absolute temperature, respectively.) The factor 2 is 
present in the denominator of the exponential because two defects (a missing cation 
and an interstitial cation) are associated with each Frenkel defect. 

Similarly, for Schottky defects, in an AX-type compound, the equilibrium num¬ 
ber (N s ) is a function of temperature as 

<i23) 

where Q s represents the Schottky defect energy of formation. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.4 


Computation of the Number of Schottky Defects in KCI 

Calculate the number of Schottky defects per cubic meter in potassium chlo¬ 
ride at 500°C. The energy required to form each Schottky defect is 2.6 eV, 
whereas the density for KCI (at 500°C) is 1.955 g/cm 3 . 


Solution 

To solve this problem it is necessary to use Equation 12.3. However, we must 
first compute the value of N (the number of lattice sites per cubic meter); this 
is possible using a modified form of Equation 4.2: 


N = 


N aP

(12.4) 


where N A is Avogadro’s number (6.022 XlO 23 atoms/mol), p is the density, and 
A k and A cl are the atomic weights for potassium and chlorine (i.e., 39.10 and 
35.45 g/mol), respectively. Therefore, 

(6.022 X 10 23 atoms/mol)(1.955 g/cm 3 )(10 6 cm 3 /m 3 ) 

N 39.10 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol 

= 1.58 X 10 28 lattice sites/m 3

Impurities in Ceramics 

Impurity atoms can form solid solutions in ceramic materials much as they do in 
metals. Solid solutions of both substitutional and interstitial types are possible. For 
an interstitial, the ionic radius of the impurity must be relatively small in compar¬ 
ison to the anion. Because there are both anions and cations, a substitutional im¬ 
purity will substitute for the host ion to which it is most similar in an electrical sense: 
if the impurity atom normally forms a cation in a ceramic material, it most proba¬ 
bly will substitute for a host cation. For example, in sodium chloride, impurity 
Ca 2+ and O 2- ions would most likely substitute for Na + and Cl - ions, respectively. 
Schematic representations for cation and anion substitutional as well as interstitial 
impurities are shown in Figure 12.23. To achieve any appreciable solid solubility of 
substituting impurity atoms, the ionic size and charge must be very nearly the same 
as those of one of the host ions. For an impurity ion having a charge different from 
the host ion for which it substitutes, the crystal must compensate for this difference 
in charge so that electroneutrality is maintained with the solid. One way this is ac¬ 
complished is by the formation of lattice defects—vacancies or interstitials of both 
ion types, as discussed previously. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 12.5 

Determination of Possible Point Defect Types in NaCI Due 
to the Presence of Ca 2+ Ions 

If electroneutrality is to be preserved, what point defects are possible in NaCI 
when a Ca 2+ substitutes for an Na + ion? How many of these defects exist for 
every Ca 2+ ion? 





476 * Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics 


Solution 

Replacement of an Na + by a Ca 2+ ion introduces one extra positive charge. 
Electroneutrality is maintained when either a single positive charge is elimi¬ 
nated or another single negative charge is added. Removal of a positive charge 
is accomplished by the formation of one Na + vacancy. Alternatively, a Cl - 
interstitial will supply an additional negative charge, negating the effect of 
each Ca 2+ ion. However, as mentioned earlier, the formation of this defect is 
highly unlikely.

12.6 DIFFUSION IN IONIC MATERIALS 

For ionic compounds, the phenomenon of diffusion is more complicated than for 
metals inasmuch as it is necessary to consider the diffusive motion of two types 
of ions that have opposite charges. Diffusion in these materials usually occurs by 
a vacancy mechanism (Figure 5.3a). Also, as we noted in Section 12.5, in order to 
maintain charge neutrality in an ionic material, the following may be said about 
vacancies: (1) ion vacancies occur in pairs [as with Schottky defects (Figure 12.21)], 
(2) they form in nonstoichiometric compounds (Figure 12.22), and (3) they are 
created by substitutional impurity ions having different charge states than the host 
ions (Example Problem 12.5). In any event, associated with the diffusive motion 
of a single ion is a transference of electrical charge. In order to maintain local¬ 
ized charge neutrality in the vicinity of this moving ion, another species having 
an equal and opposite charge must accompany the ion’s diffusive motion. Possi¬ 
ble charged species include another vacancy, an impurity atom, or an electronic 
carrier [i.e., a free electron or hole (Section 18.6)]. It follows that the rate of dif¬ 
fusion of these electrically charged couples is limited by the diffusion rate of the 
slowest-moving species. 

When an external electric field is applied across an ionic solid, the electrically 
charged ions migrate (i.e., diffuse) in response to forces that are brought to bear 
on them. As we discuss in Section 18.16, this ionic motion gives rise to an electric 
current. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity is a function of the diffusion coef¬ 
ficient (Equation 18.23). Consequently, much of the diffusion data for ionic solids 
come from electrical conductivity measurements. 


12.7 CERAMIC PHASE DIAGRAMS 

Phase diagrams have been experimentally determined for a large number of ce¬ 
ramic systems. For binary or two-component phase diagrams, it is frequently the 
case that the two components are compounds that share a common element, often 
oxygen. These diagrams may have configurations similar to metal-metal systems,

and they are interpreted in the same way. For a review of the interpretation of phase 
diagrams, the reader is referred to Section 9.8. 

The Al 2 03 -Cr 2 03 System 

One of the relatively simple ceramic phase diagrams is that found for the aluminum 
oxide-chromium oxide system, Figure 12.24. This diagram has the same form as the 
isomorphous copper-nickel phase diagram (Figure 9.3a), consisting of single liquid 
and single solid phase regions separated by a two-phase solid-liquid region having 
the shape of a blade. The Al 2 03 -Cr 2 03 solid solution is a substitutional one in which 
Al 3+ substitutes for Cr 3+ , and vice versa. It exists for all compositions below the 
melting point of A1 2 0 3 inasmuch as both aluminum and chromium ions have the 
same charge as well as similar radii (0.053 and 0.062 nm, respectively). Furthermore, 
both A1 2 0 3 and Cr 2 0 3 have the same crystal structure. 

The Mg0-Al 2 0 3 System 

The phase diagram for the magnesium oxide-aluminum oxide system (Figure 12.25) 
is similar in many respects to the lead-magnesium diagram (Figure 9.20). There ex¬ 
ists an intermediate phase, or better, a compound called spinel, which has the chem¬ 
ical formula MgAl 2 0 4 (or Mg0-Al 2 0 3 ). Even though spinel is a distinct compound 
[of composition 50 mol% Al 2 O 3 -50 mol% MgO (72 wt% Al 2 0 3 -28 wt% MgO)], it 
is represented on the phase diagram as a single-phase field rather than as a vertical 
line, as for Mg 2 Pb (Figure 9.20); that is, there is a range of compositions over which 
spinel is a stable compound. Thus, spinel is nonstoichiometric for other than the 50 
mol% Al 2 O 3 -50 mol% MgO composition. Furthermore, there is limited solubility of 
A1 2 0 3 in MgO below about 1400°C (2550°F) at the left-hand extremity of Figure 
12.25, which is due primarily to the differences in charge and radii of the Mg 2+ and

in A1 2 0 3 , as evidenced by a lack of a terminal solid solution on the right-hand side 
of the phase diagram. Also, two eutectics are found, one on either side of the spinel 
phase field, and stoichiometric spinel melts congruently at about 2100°C (3800°F). 

The Zr0 2 -CaO System 

Another important binary ceramic system is that for zirconium oxide (zirconia) and 
calcium oxide (calcia); a portion of this phase diagram is shown in Figure 12.26. The 
horizontal axis extends to only about 31 wt% CaO (50 mol% CaO), at which com¬ 
position the compound CaZr0 3 forms. It is worth noting that one eutectic (2250°C 
and 23 wt% CaO) and two eutectoid (1000°C and 2.5 wt% CaO, and 850°C and 7.5 
wt% CaO) reactions are found for this system. 

It may also be observed from Figure 12.26 that Zr0 2 phases having three dif¬ 
ferent crystal structures exist in this system—tetragonal, monoclinic, and cubic. Pure 
Zr0 2 experiences a tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation at about 1150°C 
(2102°F). A relatively large volume change accompanies this transformation, re¬ 
sulting in the formation of cracks that render a ceramic ware useless. This problem 
is overcome by “stabilizing” the zirconia by adding between about 3 and 7 wt% 
CaO. Over this composition range and at temperatures above about 1000°C, both 
cubic and tetragonal phases will be present. Upon cooling to room temperature un¬ 
der normal cooling conditions, the monoclinic and CaZr 4 0 9 phases do not form (as 
predicted from the phase diagram); consequently, the cubic and tetragonal phases 
are retained, and crack formation is circumvented. A zirconia material having a cal¬ 
cia content within the range cited is termed a partially stabilized zirconia, or PSZ. 
Yttrium oxide (Y 2 0 3 ) and magnesium oxide are also used as stabilizing agents. Fur¬ 
thermore, for higher stabilizer contents, only the cubic phase may be retained at 
room temperature; such a material is fully stabilized.

The Si0 2 -Al 2 0 3 System 

Commercially, the silica-alumina system is an important one because the principal 
constituents of many ceramic refractories are these two materials. Figure 12.27 
shows the Si0 2 -Al 2 0 3 phase diagram. The polymorphic form of silica that is stable 
at these temperatures is termed cristobalite , the unit cell for which is shown in 
Figure 12.10. Silica and alumina are not mutually soluble in one another, which is 
evidenced by the absence of terminal solid solutions at both extremities of the phase 
diagram. Also, it may be noted that the intermediate compound mullite, 3 Al 2 0 3 -2Si0 2 , 
exists, which is represented as a narrow phase field in Figure 12.27; furthermore, 
mullite melts incongruently at 1890°C (3435°F). A single eutectic exists at 1587°C 
(2890°F) and 7.7 wt% A1 2 0 3 . In Section 13.5, refractory ceramic materials, the prime 
constituents for which are silica and alumina, are discussed.

Mechanical Properties 

Prior to the Bronze Age, human tools and vessels were primarily made of stone (a 
ceramic). Between 3000 and 4000 years ago, metals came into widespread use 
because of their toughness that is derived from their ductility. For most of that his¬ 
tory, ceramic materials were somewhat limited in applicability because of their brit¬ 
tle nature. Their principal drawback has been a disposition to catastrophic fracture 
in a brittle manner with very little energy absorption. Although many new com¬ 
posites and other multiphase ceramics with useful toughness are being developed 
(often mimicking naturally occurring composite ceramics such as seashells), the bulk 
of ceramic materials currently in use are brittle. 

12.8 BRITTLE FRACTURE OF CERAMICS 

At room temperature, both crystalline and noncrystalline ceramics almost always 
fracture before any plastic deformation can occur in response to an applied tensile 
load. The topics of brittle fracture and fracture mechanics, as discussed previously 
in Sections 8.4 and 8.5, also relate to the fracture of ceramic materials; they will be 
reviewed briefly in this context. 

The brittle fracture process consists of the formation and propagation of cracks 
through the cross section of material in a direction perpendicular to the applied 
load. Crack growth in crystalline ceramics may be either transgranular (i.e., through 
the grains) or intergranular (i.e., along grain boundaries); for transgranular fracture, 
cracks propagate along specific crystallographic (or cleavage) planes, planes of high 
atomic density.

The measured fracture strengths of most ceramic materials are substantially 
lower than predicted by theory from interatomic bonding forces. This may be explained 
by very small and omnipresent flaws in the material that serve as stress raisers— 
points at which the magnitude of an applied tensile stress is amplified and no mech¬ 
anism such as plastic deformation exists to slow down or divert such cracks. For 
single-phase (i.e., monolithic) ceramics, the degree of stress amplification depends 
on crack length and tip radius of curvature according to Equation 8.1, being great¬ 
est for long and pointed flaws. These stress raisers may be minute surface or inte¬ 
rior cracks (microcracks), internal pores, inclusions, and grain corners, which are 
virtually impossible to eliminate or control. For example, even moisture and con¬ 
taminants in the atmosphere can introduce surface cracks in freshly drawn glass 
fibers, thus deleteriously affecting the strength. A stress concentration at a flaw tip 
can cause a crack to form, which may propagate until the eventual failure. 

The measure of a ceramic material’s ability to resist fracture when a crack is 
present is specified in terms of fracture toughness. The plane strain fracture tough¬ 
ness K Ic , as discussed in Section 8.5, is defined according to the expression 

K Ic = YaVmi (12.5) 

where Y is a dimensionless parameter or function that depends on both specimen 
and crack geometries, a is the applied stress, and a is the length of a surface crack 
or half of the length of an internal crack. Crack propagation will not occur as long 
as the right-hand side of Equation 12.5 is less than the plane strain fracture tough¬ 
ness of the material. Plane strain fracture toughness values for ceramic materials 
are smaller than for metals; typically they are below 10 MPaVin (9 ksiVm.). Val¬ 
ues of K lc for several ceramic materials are included in Table 8.1 and Table B.5 of 
Appendix B. 

Under some circumstances, fracture of ceramic materials will occur by the slow 
propagation of cracks, when stresses are static in nature, and the right-hand side of 
Equation 12.5 is less than K Ic . This phenomenon is called static fatigue, or delayed 
fracture; use of the term fatigue is somewhat misleading inasmuch as fracture may 
occur in the absence of cyclic stresses (metal fatigue was discussed in Chapter 8). 
This type of fracture is especially sensitive to environmental conditions, specifi¬ 
cally when moisture is present in the atmosphere. Relative to mechanism, a stress- 
corrosion process probably occurs at the crack tips. That is, the combination of an 
applied tensile stress and atmospheric moisture at crack tips causes ionic bonds to 
rupture; this leads to a sharpening and lengthening of the cracks until, ultimately, 
one crack grows to a size capable of rapid propagation according to Equation 8.3. 
Furthermore, the duration of stress application preceding fracture diminishes with 
increasing stress. Consequently, when specifying the static fatigue strength, the time 
of stress application should also be stipulated. Silicate glasses are especially sus¬ 
ceptible to this type of fracture; it has also been observed in other ceramic materi¬ 
als, including porcelain, portland cement, high-alumina ceramics, barium titanate, 
and silicon nitride. 

There is usually considerable variation and scatter in the fracture strength for 
many specimens of a specific brittle ceramic material. A distribution of fracture 
strengths for a silicon nitride material is shown in Figure 12.28. This phenomenon 
may be explained by the dependence of fracture strength on the probability of the 
existence of a flaw that is capable of initiating a crack. This probability varies from 
specimen to specimen of the same material and depends on fabrication technique 
and any subsequent treatment. Specimen size or volume also influences fracture

strength; the larger the specimen, the greater this flaw existence probability, and the 
lower the fracture strength. 

For compressive stresses, there is no stress amplification associated with any exis¬ 
tent flaws. For this reason, brittle ceramics display much higher strengths in compres¬ 
sion than in tension (on the order of a factor of 10), and they are generally utilized 
when load conditions are compressive. Also, the fracture strength of a brittle ceramic 
may be enhanced dramatically by imposing residual compressive stresses at its sur¬ 
face. One way this may be accomplished is by thermal tempering (see Section 13.9). 

Statistical theories have been developed that in conjunction with experimental 
data are used to determine the risk of fracture for a given material; a discussion of 
these is beyond the scope of the present treatment. However, because of the dis¬ 
persion in the measured fracture strengths of brittle ceramic materials, average val¬ 
ues and factors of safety as discussed in Sections 6.11 and 6.12 are not normally 
employed for design purposes. 

Fractography of Ceramics 

It is sometimes necessary to acquire information regarding the cause of a ceramic 
fracture so that measures may be taken to reduce the likelihood of future incidents. 
A failure analysis normally focuses on determination of the location, type, and 
source of the crack-initiating flaw. A fractographic study (Section 8.3) is normally 
a part of such an analysis, which involves examining the path of crack propagation 
as well as microscopic features of the fracture surface. It is often possible to con¬ 
duct an investigation of this type using simple and inexpensive equipment—for 
example, a magnifying glass and/or a low-power stereo binocular optical microscope 
in conjunction with a light source. When higher magnifications are required, the 
scanning electron microscope is utilized. 

After nucleation, and during propagation, a crack accelerates until a critical (or 
terminal) velocity is achieved; for glass, this critical value is approximately one-half 
of the speed of sound. Upon reaching this critical velocity, a crack may branch (or

bifurcate), a process that may be successively repeated until a family of cracks is 
produced. Typical crack configurations for four common loading schemes are shown 
in Figure 12.29. The site of nucleation can often be traced back to the point where 
a set of cracks converges or comes together. Furthermore, the rate of crack accel¬ 
eration increases with increasing stress level; correspondingly the degree of branch¬ 
ing also increases with rising stress. For example, from experience we know that 
when a large rock strikes (and probably breaks) a window, more crack branching 
results [i.e., more and smaller cracks form (or more broken fragments are pro¬ 
duced)] than for a small pebble impact. 

During propagation, a crack interacts with the microstructure of the material, 
with the stress, and with elastic waves that are generated; these interactions produce 
distinctive features on the fracture surface. Furthermore, these features provide 
important information on where the crack initiated and the source of the crack- 
producing defect. In addition, measurement of the approximate fracture-producing 
stress may be useful; stress magnitude is indicative of whether the ceramic piece 
was excessively weak or the in-service stress was greater than anticipated. 

Several microscopic features normally found on the crack surfaces of failed 
ceramic pieces are shown in the schematic diagram of Figure 12.30 and also the 
photomicrograph in Figure 12.31. The crack surface that formed during the initial 
acceleration stage of propagation is flat and smooth, and appropriately termed the 
mirror region (Figure 12.30). For glass fractures, this mirror region is extremely flat 
and highly reflective; on the other hand, for polycrystalline ceramics, the flat mir¬ 
ror surfaces are rougher and have a granular texture. The outer perimeter of the 
mirror region is roughly circular, with the crack origin at its center. 

Upon reaching its critical velocity, the crack begins to branch—that is, the crack 
surface changes propagation direction. At this time there is a roughening of the 
crack interface on a microscopic scale, and the formation of two more surface 
features —mist and hackle; these are also noted in Figures 12.30 and 12.31. The mist 
is a faint annular region just outside the mirror; it is often not discernible for 
polycrystalline ceramic pieces. And beyond the mist is the hackle, which has an even 
rougher texture. The hackle is composed of a set of striations or lines that radiate

away from the crack source in the direction of crack propagation; furthermore, they 
intersect near the crack initiation site and may be used to pinpoint its location. 

Qualitative information regarding the magnitude of the fracture-producing 
stress is available from measurement of the mirror radius (r m in Figure 12.30). This 
radius is a function of the acceleration rate of a newly formed crack—that is, the 
greater this acceleration rate, the sooner the crack reaches its critical velocity, and 
the smaller the mirror radius. Furthermore, the acceleration rate increases with 
stress level. Thus, as fracture stress level increases, the mirror radius decreases; ex¬ 
perimentally it has been observed that

Elastic (sonic) waves are also generated during a fracture event, and the locus of 
intersections of these waves with a propagating crack front gives rise to another type 
of surface feature known as a Wallner line. Wallner lines are arc shaped, and they pro¬ 
vide information regarding stress distributions and directions of crack propagation.

Flexural Strength 

The stress-strain behavior of brittle ceramics is not usually ascertained by a tensile 
test as outlined in Section 6.2, for three reasons. First, it is difficult to prepare and 
test specimens having the required geometry. Second, it is difficult to grip brittle 
materials without fracturing them; third, ceramics fail after only about 0.1% strain, 
which necessitates that tensile specimens be perfectly aligned to avoid the presence 
of bending stresses, which are not easily calculated. Therefore, a more suitable trans¬ 
verse bending test is most frequently employed, in which a rod specimen having 
either a circular or rectangular cross section is bent until fracture using a three- or 
four-point loading technique; 2 the three-point loading scheme is illustrated in 
Figure 12.32. At the point of loading, the top surface of the specimen is placed in 
a state of compression, while the bottom surface is in tension. Stress is computed 
from the specimen thickness, the bending moment, and the moment of inertia of 
the cross section; these parameters are noted in Figure 12.32 for rectangular and 
circular cross sections. The maximum tensile stress (as determined using these stress 
expressions) exists at the bottom specimen surface directly below the point of load 
application. Because the tensile strengths of ceramics are about one-tenth of their 
compressive strengths, and because fracture occurs on the tensile specimen face, the 
flexure test is a reasonable substitute for the tensile test. 

The stress at fracture using this flexure test is known as the flexural strength, 
modulus of rupture, fracture strength, or bend strength, an important mechanical 
parameter for brittle ceramics. For a rectangular cross section, the flexural strength 
cr fs is equal to

stress) there is an increase in the probability of the existence of a crack-producing 
flaw and, consequently, a decrease in flexural strength. In addition, the magnitude 
of flexural strength for a specific ceramic material will be greater than its fracture 
strength measured from a tensile test. This phenomenon may be explained by dif¬ 
ferences in specimen volume that are exposed to tensile stresses: the entirety of a 
tensile specimen is under tensile stress, whereas only some volume fraction of a 
flexural specimen is subjected to tensile stresses—those regions in the vicinity of 
the specimen surface opposite to the point of load application (see Figure 12.32). 

Elastic Behavior 

The elastic stress-strain behavior for ceramic materials using these flexure tests is 
similar to the tensile test results for metals: a linear relationship exists between 
stress and strain. Figure 12.33 compares the stress-strain behavior to fracture for 
aluminum oxide and glass. Again, the slope in the elastic region is the modulus of 
elasticity; the range of moduli of elasticity for ceramic materials is between about 
70 and 500 GPa (10 X 10 6 and 70 X 10 6 psi), being slightly higher than for metals. 
Table 12.5 lists values for several ceramic materials. A more comprehensive tabu¬ 
lation is contained in Table B.2 of Appendix B. Also, from Figure 12.33 note that 
neither material experiences plastic deformation prior to fracture. 

12.10 MECHANISMS OF PLASTIC DEFORMATION 

Although at room temperature most ceramic materials suffer fracture before the 
onset of plastic deformation, a brief exploration into the possible mechanisms is 
worthwhile. Plastic deformation is different for crystalline and noncrystalline ce¬ 
ramics; however, each is discussed. 

Crystalline Ceramics 

For crystalline ceramics, plastic deformation occurs, as with metals, by the motion 
of dislocations (Chapter 7). One reason for the hardness and brittleness of these 
materials is the difficulty of slip (or dislocation motion). For crystalline ceramic ma¬ 
terials for which the bonding is predominantly ionic, there are very few slip systems 



488 


Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics 


viscosity 


(crystallographic planes and directions within those planes) along which disloca¬ 
tions may move. This is a consequence of the electrically charged nature of the ions. 
For slip in some directions, ions of like charge are brought into close proximity to 
one another; because of electrostatic repulsion, this mode of slip is very restricted, 
to the extent that plastic deformation in ceramics is rarely measurable at room tem¬ 
perature. By way of contrast, in metals, because all atoms are electrically neutral, 
considerably more slip systems are operable and, consequently, dislocation motion 
is much more facile. 

On the other hand, for ceramics in which the bonding is highly covalent, slip is 
also difficult and they are brittle for the following reasons: (1) the covalent bonds 
are relatively strong, (2) there are also limited numbers of slip systems, and (3) dis¬ 
location structures are complex. 


Noncrystalline Ceramics 

Plastic deformation does not occur by dislocation motion for noncrystalline ceramics 
because there is no regular atomic structure. Rather, these materials deform by vis¬ 
cous flow, the same manner in which liquids deform; the rate of deformation is 
proportional to the applied stress. In response to an applied shear stress, atoms or 
ions slide past one another by the breaking and re-forming of interatomic bonds. 
However, there is no prescribed manner or direction in which this occurs, as with 
dislocations. Viscous flow on a macroscopic scale is demonstrated in Figure 12.34. 

The characteristic property for viscous flow, viscosity, is a measure of a non¬ 
crystalline material’s resistance to deformation. For viscous flow in a liquid that 
originates from shear stresses imposed by two flat and parallel plates, the viscosity 
7] is the ratio of the applied shear stress t and the change in velocity dv with dis¬ 
tance dy in a direction perpendicular to and away from the plates, or 


T 

7 ] = - 

dv/dy 


F/A 

dv/dy 


( 12 . 8 ) 


This scheme is represented in Figure 12.34. 

The units for viscosity are poise (P) and pascal-seconds (Pa-s); 1 P = 1 dyne*s/cm 2 , 
and 1 Pa-s = 1 N-s/m 2 . Conversion from one system of units to the other is accor¬ 
ding to 


10 P = 1 Pa-s 


Liquids have relatively low viscosities; for example, the viscosity of water at room 
temperature is about 10 -3 Pa-s. On the other hand, glasses have extremely large

the viscous flow of a liquid or fluid 
glass in response to an applied 
shear force. 



















12.11 Miscellaneous Mechanical Considerations * 489 


viscosities at ambient temperatures, which is accounted for by strong interatomic 
bonding. As the temperature is raised, the magnitude of the bonding is diminished, 
the sliding motion or flow of the atoms or ions is facilitated, and subsequently there 
is an attendant decrease in viscosity. A discussion of the temperature dependence 
of viscosity for glasses is deferred to Section 13.9. 

12.11 MISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS 

Influence of Porosity 

As discussed in Sections 13.10 and 13.11, for some ceramic fabrication techniques, 
the precursor material is in the form of a powder. Subsequent to compaction or 
forming of these powder particles into the desired shape, pores or void spaces will 
exist between the powder particles. During the ensuing heat treatment, much of this 
porosity will be eliminated; however, often this pore elimination process is incom¬ 
plete and some residual porosity will remain (Figure 13.17). Any residual porosity 
will have a deleterious influence on both the elastic properties and strength. For 
example, for some ceramic materials the magnitude of the modulus of elasticity E 
decreases with volume fraction porosity P according to 

Dependence of 

modulus of elasticity E = E 0 (l — 1.9 P + 0.9P ) (12.9) 

on volume fraction 

porosity where E 0 is the modulus of elasticity of the nonporous material. The influence of 

volume fraction porosity on the modulus of elasticity for aluminum oxide is shown 
in Figure 12.35; the curve represented in the figure is according to Equation 12.9. 

Porosity is deleterious to the flexural strength for two reasons: (1) pores reduce 
the cross-sectional area across which a load is applied, and (2) they also act as stress 
concentrators—for an isolated spherical pore, an applied tensile stress is amplified 
by a factor of 2. The influence of porosity on strength is rather dramatic; for example,

10 vol% porosity will often decrease the flexural strength by 50% from the meas¬ 
ured value for the nonporous material. The degree of the influence of pore volume 
on flexural strength is demonstrated in Figure 12.36, again for aluminum oxide. Ex¬ 
perimentally it has been shown that the flexural strength decreases exponentially 
with volume fraction porosity (P) as 

o> = o-o exp (- nP ) (12.10) 

In this expression cr 0 and n are experimental constants. 

Hardness 

Accurate hardness measurements are difficult to conduct inasmuch as ceramic ma¬ 
terials are brittle and highly susceptible to cracking when indenters are forced into 
their surfaces; extensive crack formation leads to inaccurate readings. Spherical 
indenters (as with Rockwell and Brinell tests) are normally not used for ceramic 
materials because they produce severe cracking. Rather, hardnesses of this class of 
materials are measured using Vickers and Knoop techniques that employ indenters 
having pyramidal shapes (Section 6.10, Table 6.5). 3 Vickers is widely used for meas¬ 
uring hardnesses of ceramics; however, for very brittle ceramic materials, Knoop is 
often preferred. Furthermore, for both techniques, hardness decreases with in¬ 
creasing load (or indentation size), but ultimately reaches a constant hardness 
plateau that is independent of load; the value of hardness at this plateau varies from 
ceramic to ceramic. An ideal hardness test would be designed so as to use a suffi¬ 
ciently large load that lies near this plateau, yet of magnitude that does not intro¬ 
duce excessive cracking.

Possibly the most desirable mechanical characteristic of ceramics is their hard¬ 
ness; the hardest known materials belong to this group. A listing of a number of dif¬ 
ferent ceramic materials according to Vickers hardness is contained in Table 12.6. 4 
These materials are often utilized when an abrasive or grinding action is required 
(Section 13.6). 

Creep 

Often ceramic materials experience creep deformation as a result of exposure 
to stresses (usually compressive) at elevated temperatures. In general, the time- 
deformation creep behavior of ceramics is similar to that of metals (Section 8.12); 
however, creep occurs at higher temperatures in ceramics. High-temperature com¬ 
pressive creep tests are conducted on ceramic materials to ascertain creep defor¬ 
mation as a function of temperature and stress level. 

SUMMARY 


Crystal Structures 

• Interatomic bonding in ceramics ranges from purely ionic to totally covalent. 

• For predominantly ionic bonding: 

Metallic cations are positively charged, whereas nonmetallic ions have neg¬ 
ative charges. 

Crystal structure is determined by (1) the charge magnitude on each ion and 
(2) the radius of each type of ion. 

• Many of the simpler crystal structures are described in terms of unit cells: 

Rock salt (Figure 12.2) 

Cesium chloride (Figure 12.3) 

Zinc blende (Figure 12.4) 

Fluorite (Figure 12.5) 

Perovskite (Figure 12.6) 

• Some crystal structures may be generated from the stacking of close-packed 
planes of anions; cations fill interstitial tetrahedral and/or octahedral positions 
that exist between adjacent planes. 


4 In the past the units for Vickers hardness were kg/mm 2 ; in Table 12.6 we use the SI units 
of GPa. 







492 * Chapter 12 / Structures and Properties of Ceramics 

• The theoretical density of a ceramic material may be computed using 
Equation 12.1. 

Silicate Ceramics 

• For the silicates, structure is more conveniently represented in terms of intercon¬ 
necting SiC> 4 - tetrahedra (Figure 12.9). Relatively complex structures may result 
when other cations (e.g., Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Al 3+ ) and anions (e.g., OH - ) are added. 

• Silicate ceramics include the following: 

Crystalline silica (Si0 2 ) (as cristobalite, Figure 12.10) 

Layered silicates (Figures 12.13 and 12.14) 

Noncrystalline silica glasses (Figure 12.11) 

Carbon 

• Carbon (sometimes also considered a ceramic) may exist in several polymorphic 
forms: 

Diamond (Figure 12.15) 

Graphite (Figure 12.17) 

The fullerenes (e.g., C 60 , Figure 12.18) 

Nanotubes (Figure 12.19) 

• Each of these materials has its own unique properties: 

Diamond—hardness, high thermal conductivity 

Graphite—high-temperature chemical stability, good lubricative properties 
Fullerenes—electrically insulative, conductive, or semiconductive 
Carbon nanotubes—extremely strong and stiff, electrically conductive or 
semiconductive 

Imperfections in Ceramics 

• With regard to atomic point defects, interstitials and vacancies for each anion and 
cation type are possible (Figure 12.20). 

• Inasmuch as electrical charges are associated with atomic point defects in ceramic 
materials, defects sometimes occur in pairs (e.g., Frenkel and Schottky) in order 
to maintain charge neutrality. 

• A stoichiometric ceramic is one in which the ratio of cations to anions is exactly 
the same as predicted by the chemical formula. 

• Nonstoichiometric materials are possible in cases where one of the ions may 
exist in more than one ionic state—e.g., Fe^^O for Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ . 

• Addition of impurity atoms may result in the formation of substitutional or in¬ 
terstitial solid solutions. For substitutional, an impurity atom will substitute for 
that host atom to which it is most similar in an electrical sense. 

Diffusion in Ionic Materials 

• Diffusion in ionic materials normally occurs by a vacancy mechanism; localized 
charge neutrality is maintained by the coupled diffusive motion of a charged 
vacancy and some other charged entity. 

Ceramic Phase Diagrams 

• The general characteristics of ceramic phase diagrams are similar to those for 
metallic systems. 


Summary • 493 


• Diagrams for AI 2 O 3 -& 2 O 3 (Figure 12.24), Mg0-Al 2 0 3 (Figure 12.25), Zr0 2 -Ca0 
(Figure 12.26), and Si0 2 -Al 2 0 3 (Figure 12.27) systems were discussed. 

• These diagrams are especially useful in assessing the high-temperature perform¬ 
ance of ceramic materials. 

Brittle Fracture of Ceramics 

• For ceramic materials, microcracks, the presence of which is very difficult to con¬ 
trol, result in amplification of applied tensile stresses and account for relatively 
low fracture strengths (flexural strengths). 

• Considerable variation in fracture strength for specimens of a specific material 
results inasmuch as the size of a crack-initiating flaw will vary from specimen to 
specimen. 

• This stress amplification does not occur with compressive loads; consequently, 
ceramics are stronger in compression. 

• Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of a ceramic material may reveal 
the location and source of the crack-producing flaw (Figure 12.31). 

Stress-Strain Behavior 

• The stress-strain behaviors and fracture strengths of ceramic materials are 
determined using transverse bending tests. 

• Flexural strengths as measured from three-point transverse bending tests may 
be determined for rectangular and circular cross-sections using, respectively, 
Equations 12.7a and 12.7b. 

Mechanisms of Plastic Deformation 

• Any plastic deformation of crystalline ceramics is a result of dislocation motion; 
the brittleness of these materials is explained, in part, by the limited number of 
operable slip systems. 

• The mode of plastic deformation for noncrystalline materials is by viscous flow; 
a material’s resistance to deformation is expressed as viscosity (in units of Pa-s). 
At room temperature, the viscosities of many noncrystalline ceramics are 
extremely high. 

Influence of Porosity 

• Many ceramic bodies contain residual porosity, which is deleterious to both their 
moduli of elasticity and fracture strengths. 

Modulus of elasticity depends on and decreases with volume fraction porosity 
according to Equation 12.9. 

The diminishment of flexural strength with volume fraction porosity is 
described by Equation 12.10. 


Hardness 

• Flardness of ceramic materials is difficult to measure because of their brittleness 
and susceptibility to cracking when indented. 

• Microindentation Knoop and Vickers techniques are normally utilized, which 
employ pyramidal-shaped indenters. 

• The hardest known materials are ceramics, which characteristic makes them 
especially attractive for use as abrasives (Section 13.6).

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

One stage in the fabrication of glass-ceramics involves the formation of a silica glass, 
to which other ingredients have been added that facilitate forming and heat treat¬ 
ing procedures. The notion of noncrystallinity was introduced in Chapter 3, whereas 
in this chapter we discussed silica glasses and their structures (Figure 12.11). Fur¬ 
thermore, Chapter 13 details the conversion of this glassy material into one that is 
polycrystalline. The following diagram indicates relationships in the development 
of these concepts.

12.37 From Figure 12.25, the phase diagram for 
the Mg0-Al 2 0 3 system, it may be noted that 
the spinel solid solution exists over a range

be determined using a variation of Equation 
8.1. Compute the critical crack tip radius for 
an A1 2 0 3 specimen that experiences tensile 
fracture at an applied stress of 275 MPa 
(40,000 psi). Assume a critical surface crack 
length of 2 X 10 3 mm and a theoretical frac¬ 
ture strength of El 10, where E is the modu¬ 
lus of elasticity. 

12.41 The fracture strength of glass may be in¬ 
creased by etching away a thin surface layer. 
It is believed that the etching may alter sur¬ 
face crack geometry (i.e., reduce crack 
length and increase the tip radius). Compute 
the ratio of the original and etched crack tip 
radii for an eightfold increase in fracture 
strength if two-thirds of the crack length is 
removed.

WHY STUDY Applications and Processing of Ceramics? 


It is important for the engineer to realize how the 
applications and processing of ceramic materials are 
influenced by their mechanical and thermal proper¬ 
ties, such as hardness, brittleness, and high melting 
temperatures. For example, ceramic pieces normally 
cannot be fabricated using conventional metal¬ 
forming techniques (Chapter 11). As we discuss in 
this chapter, they are often formed using powder 
compaction methods, and subsequently fired (i.e., 
heat-treated). 

In the processing/structure/propertiWperformance 
scheme, reasons for studying applications and process¬ 
ing of ceramics are as follows: 

• During the processing of a glass-ceramic, it is neces¬ 
sary to melt and subsequently shape a viscous mass. 


Melting and shaping procedures are facilitated with 
a knowledge of the temperature dependence of 
viscosity. The viscosity-temperature behavior of 
glasses is presented in this chapter. 

• Another step in the processing of glass-ceramics is 
crystallization of the glass material. Crystallization 
is accomplished during cooling from an elevated 
temperature. We also explore in this chapter 
how rate of cooling affects degree of crystalli¬ 
zation. 

• In the crystallization process a noncrystalline 
material is transformed into a fine-grained poly¬ 
crystalline one. Accompanying this transforma¬ 
tion is an alteration in properties, which is also 
discussed. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe the process that is used to produce 
glass-ceramics. 

2. Name the two types of clay products, and give 
two examples of each. 

3. Cite three important requirements that normally 
must be met by refractory ceramics and abrasive 
ceramics. 

4. Describe the mechanism by which cement hardens 
when water is added. 


5. Name and briefly describe four forming methods 
that are used to fabricate glass pieces. 

6. Briefly describe and explain the procedure by 
which glass pieces are thermally tempered. 

7. Briefly describe processes that occur during 
the drying and firing of clay-based ceramic 
ware. 

8. Briefly describe/diagram the sintering process of 
powder particle aggregates. 


13.1 INTRODUCTION 

The preceding discussions of the properties of materials have demonstrated that 
there is a significant disparity between the physical characteristics of metals and 
ceramics. Consequently, these materials are used in totally different kinds of ap¬ 
plications and, in this regard, tend to complement each other and also the poly¬ 
mers. Most ceramic materials fall into an application-classification scheme that 
includes the following groups: glasses, structural clay products, whitewares, refrac¬ 
tories, abrasives, cements, and the newly developed advanced ceramics. Figure 13.1 
presents a taxonomy of these several types; some discussion is devoted to each in 
this chapter.

Types and Applications of Ceramics 

13.2 GLASSES 

The glasses are a familiar group of ceramics; containers, lenses, and fiberglass rep¬ 
resent typical applications. As already mentioned, they are noncrystalline silicates 
containing other oxides, notably CaO, Na 2 0, K 2 0, and A1 2 0 3 , which influence the 
glass properties. A typical soda-lime glass consists of approximately 70 wt% Si0 2 , 
the balance being mainly Na 2 0 (soda) and CaO (lime). The compositions of sev¬ 
eral common glass materials are contained in Table 13.1. Possibly the two prime 
assets of these materials are their optical transparency and the relative ease with 
which they may be fabricated. 

13.3 GLASS-CERAMICS 

Most inorganic glasses can be made to transform from a noncrystalline state to one 
that is crystalline by the proper high-temperature heat treatment. This process is

crystallization called crystallization, and the product is a fine-grained polycrystalline material that 

glass-ceramic is often called a glass-ceramic. The formation of these small glass-ceramic grains is, 

in a sense, a phase transformation, which involves nucleation and growth stages. As 
a consequence, the kinetics (i.e., the rate) of crystallization may be described using 
the same principles that were applied to phase transformations for metal systems 
in Section 10.3. For example, dependence of degree of transformation on temper¬ 
ature and time may be expressed using isothermal transformation and continuous 
cooling transformation diagrams (Sections 10.5 and 10.6). The continuous cooling 
transformation diagram for the crystallization of a lunar glass is presented in Fig¬ 
ure 13.2; the begin and end transformation curves on this plot have the same gen¬ 
eral shape as those for an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition (Figure 10.25). 
Also included are two continuous cooling curves, which are labeled “1” and “2”; the 
cooling rate represented by curve 2 is much greater than that for curve 1. As also 
noted on this plot, for the continuous cooling path represented by curve 1, crystal¬ 
lization begins at its intersection with the upper curve, and progresses as time in¬ 
creases and temperature continues to decrease; upon crossing the lower curve, all 
of the original glass has crystallized. The other cooling curve (curve 2) just misses 
the nose of the crystallization start curve. It represents a critical cooling rate (for this 
glass, 100°C/min)—that is, the minimum cooling rate for which the final room- 
temperature product is 100% glass; for cooling rates less than this, some glass- 
ceramic material will form. 

A nucleating agent (frequently titanium dioxide) is often added to the glass to 
promote crystallization. The presence of a nucleating agent shifts the begin and end 
transformation curves to shorter times. 

Properties and Applications of Glass-Ceramics 

Glass-ceramic materials have been designed to have the following characteristics: 
relatively high mechanical strengths; low coefficients of thermal expansion (to avoid 
thermal shock); relatively high temperature capabilities; good dielectric properties 
(for electronic packaging applications); and good biological compatibility. Some 
glass-ceramics may be made optically transparent; others are opaque. Possibly the 
most attractive attribute of this class of materials is the ease with which they may 
be fabricated; conventional glass-forming techniques may be used conveniently in 
the mass production of nearly pore-free ware.

13.5 Refractories * 505 


Glass-ceramics are manufactured commercially under the trade names of 
Pyroceram, CorningWare, Cercor, and Vision. The most common uses for these ma¬ 
terials are as ovenware, tableware, oven windows, and range tops—primarily be¬ 
cause of their strength and excellent resistance to thermal shock. They also serve 
as electrical insulators and as substrates for printed circuit boards and are used for 
architectural cladding and for heat exchangers and regenerators. A typical glass- 
ceramic is also included in Table 13.1.

13.4 CLAY PRODUCTS 

One of the most widely used ceramic raw materials is clay. This inexpensive ingre¬ 
dient, found naturally in great abundance, often is used as mined without any up¬ 
grading of quality. Another reason for its popularity lies in the ease with which clay 
products may be formed; when mixed in the proper proportions, clay and water 
form a plastic mass that is very amenable to shaping. The formed piece is dried to 
remove some of the moisture, after which it is fired at an elevated temperature to 
improve its mechanical strength. 

Most of the clay-based products fall within two broad classifications: the struc¬ 
tural clay products and the whitewares. Structural clay products include building 
bricks, tiles, and sewer pipes—applications in which structural integrity is important. 
The whiteware ceramics become white after the high-temperature firing. Included 
in this group are porcelain, pottery, tableware, china, and plumbing fixtures (sani¬ 
tary ware). In addition to clay, many of these products also contain nonplastic in¬ 
gredients, which influence the changes that take place during the drying and firing 
processes, and the characteristics of the finished piece (Section 13.10). 

13.5 REFRACTORIES 

Another important class of ceramics that are used in large tonnages is the refrac- 
refractory ceramic tory ceramics. The salient properties of these materials include the capacity to with¬ 
stand high temperatures without melting or decomposing and the capacity to re¬ 
main unreactive and inert when exposed to severe environments. In addition, the 
ability to provide thermal insulation is often an important consideration. Refrac¬ 
tory materials are marketed in a variety of forms, but bricks are the most common. 
Typical applications include furnace linings for metal refining, glass manufacturing, 
metallurgical heat treatment, and power generation. 

Of course, the performance of a refractory ceramic depends to a large degree 
on its composition. On this basis, there are several classifications—fireclay, silica, 
basic, and special refractories. Compositions for a number of commercial refracto¬ 
ries are listed in Table 13.2. For many commercial materials, the raw ingredients 
consist of both large (or grog) particles and fine particles, which may have differ¬ 
ent compositions. Upon firing, the fine particles normally are involved in the for¬ 
mation of a bonding phase, which is responsible for the increased strength of the

brick; this phase may be predominantly either glassy or crystalline. The service tem¬ 
perature is normally below that at which the refractory piece was fired. 

Porosity is one microstructural variable that must be controlled to produce a 
suitable refractory brick. Strength, load-bearing capacity, and resistance to attack 
by corrosive materials all increase with porosity reduction. At the same time, ther¬ 
mal insulation characteristics and resistance to thermal shock are diminished. Of 
course, the optimum porosity depends on the conditions of service. 

Fireclay Refractories 

The primary ingredients for the fireclay refractories are high-purity fireclays, alu¬ 
mina and silica mixtures usually containing between 25 and 45 wt% alumina. Accord¬ 
ing to the Si0 2 -Al 2 0 3 phase diagram, Figure 12.27, over this composition range the 
highest temperature possible without the formation of a liquid phase is 1587°C 
(2890°F). Below this temperature the equilibrium phases present are mullite and 
silica (cristobalite). During refractory service use, the presence of a small amount 
of a liquid phase may be allowable without compromising mechanical integrity. 
Above 1587°C the fraction of liquid phase present will depend on refractory com¬ 
position. Upgrading the alumina content will increase the maximum service tem¬ 
perature, allowing for the formation of a small amount of liquid. 

Fireclay bricks are used principally in furnace construction, to confine hot 
atmospheres, and to thermally insulate structural members from excessive temper¬ 
atures. For fireclay brick, strength is not ordinarily an important consideration, be¬ 
cause support of structural loads is usually not required. Some control is normally 
maintained over the dimensional accuracy and stability of the finished product. 

Silica Refractories 

The prime ingredient for silica refractories, sometimes termed acid refractories, is 
silica. These materials, well known for their high-temperature load-bearing capac¬ 
ity, are commonly used in the arched roofs of steel- and glass-making furnaces; for 
these applications, temperatures as high as 1650°C (3000°F) may be realized. Un¬ 
der these conditions some small portion of the brick will actually exist as a liquid. 
The presence of even small concentrations of alumina has an adverse influence 
on the performance of these refractories, which may be explained by the 
silica-alumina phase diagram, Figure 12.27. Because the eutectic composition (7.7 
wt% A1 2 0 3 ) is very near the silica extremity of the phase diagram, even small ad¬ 
ditions of A1 2 0 3 lower the liquidus temperature significantly, which means that sub¬ 
stantial amounts of liquid may be present at temperatures in excess of 1600°C 






13.6 Abrasives * 507 


(2910°F). Thus, the alumina content should be held to a minimum, normally to be¬ 
tween 0.2 and 1.0 wt%. 

These refractory materials are also resistant to slags that are rich in silica (called 
acid slags) and are often used as containment vessels for them. On the other hand, 
they are readily attacked by slags composed of a high proportion of CaO and/or 
MgO (basic slags), and contact with these oxide materials should be avoided. 

Basic Refractories 

The refractories that are rich in periclase, or magnesia (MgO), are termed basic, 
they may also contain calcium, chromium, and iron compounds. The presence of 
silica is deleterious to their high-temperature performance. Basic refractories are 
especially resistant to attack by slags containing high concentrations of MgO and 
CaO and find extensive use in some steel-making open hearth furnaces. 

Special Refractories 

Yet other ceramic materials are used for rather specialized refractory applications. 
Some of these are relatively high-purity oxide materials, many of which may be pro¬ 
duced with very little porosity. Included in this group are alumina, silica, magnesia, 
beryllia (BeO), zirconia (Zr0 2 ), and mullite (3Al 2 0 3 -2Si0 2 ). Others include car¬ 
bide compounds, in addition to carbon and graphite. Silicon carbide (SiC) has been 
used for electrical resistance heating elements, as a crucible material, and in inter¬ 
nal furnace components. Carbon and graphite are very refractory, but find limited ap¬ 
plication because they are susceptible to oxidation at temperatures in excess of about 
800°C (1470°F). As would be expected, these specialized refractories are relatively 
expensive.

13.6 ABRASIVES 

abrasive ceramic Abrasive ceramics are used to wear, grind, or cut away other material, which nec¬ 

essarily is softer. Therefore, the prime requisite for this group of materials is hard¬ 
ness or wear resistance; in addition, a high degree of toughness is essential to ensure 
that the abrasive particles do not easily fracture. Furthermore, high temperatures 
may be produced from abrasive frictional forces, so some refractoriness is also 
desirable. 

Diamonds, both natural and synthetic, are utilized as abrasives; however, they 
are relatively expensive. The more common ceramic abrasives include silicon car¬ 
bide, tungsten carbide (WC), aluminum oxide (or corundum), and silica sand. 

Abrasives are used in several forms—bonded to grinding wheels, as coated abra¬ 
sives, and as loose grains. In the first case, the abrasive particles are bonded to a

wheel by means of a glassy ceramic or an organic resin. The surface structure should 
contain some porosity; a continual flow of air currents or liquid coolants within the 
pores that surround the refractory grains prevents excessive heating. Figure 13.3 
shows the microstructure of a bonded abrasive, revealing abrasive grains, the bonding 
phase, and pores. 

Coated abrasives are those in which an abrasive powder is coated on some type 
of paper or cloth material; sandpaper is probably the most familiar example. Wood, 
metals, ceramics, and plastics are all frequently ground and polished using this form 
of abrasive. 

Grinding, lapping, and polishing wheels often employ loose abrasive grains that 
are delivered in some type of oil- or water-based vehicle. Diamonds, corundum, sil¬ 
icon carbide, and rouge (an iron oxide) are used in loose form over a variety of 
grain size ranges. 


13.7 CEMENTS 

cement Several familiar ceramic materials are classified as inorganic cements: cement, plas¬ 

ter of paris, and lime, which, as a group, are produced in extremely large quantities. 
The characteristic feature of these materials is that when mixed with water, they 
form a paste that subsequently sets and hardens. This trait is especially useful in 
that solid and rigid structures having just about any shape may be expeditiously 
formed. Also, some of these materials act as a bonding phase that chemically binds 
particulate aggregates into a single cohesive structure. Under these circumstances, 
the role of the cement is similar to that of the glassy bonding phase that forms when 
clay products and some refractory bricks are fired. One important difference, how¬ 
ever, is that the cementitious bond develops at room temperature. 

Of this group of materials, portland cement is consumed in the largest tonnages. 
It is produced by grinding and intimately mixing clay and lime-bearing minerals in the 
proper proportions and then heating the mixture to about 1400°C (2550°F) in a rotary 
calcination kiln; this process, sometimes called calcination, produces physical and chemical changes 

in the raw materials. The resulting “clinker” product is then ground into a very fine 
powder to which is added a small amount of gypsum (CaS0 4 -2H 2 0) to retard the set¬ 
ting process. This product is portland cement. The properties of portland cement, in¬ 
cluding setting time and final strength, to a large degree depend on its composition. 


13.8 Advanced Ceramics * 509 


Several different constituents are found in portland cement, the principal ones 
being tricalcium silicate (3Ca0-Si0 2 ) and dicalcium silicate (2Ca0-Si0 2 ). The 
setting and hardening of this material result from relatively complicated hydra¬ 
tion reactions that occur among the various cement constituents and the water 
that is added. For example, one hydration reaction involving dicalcium silicate is as 
follows: 


2Ca0-Si0 2 + jkH 2 0 2Ca0-Si0 2 -xH 2 0 (13.1) 

where x is variable and depends on how much water is available. These hydrated 
products are in the form of complex gels or crystalline substances that form the ce¬ 
mentitious bond. Hydration reactions begin just as soon as water is added to the 
cement. These are first manifested as setting (i.e., the stiffening of the once-plastic 
paste), which takes place soon after mixing, usually within several hours. Harden¬ 
ing of the mass follows as a result of further hydration, a relatively slow process 
that may continue for as long as several years. It should be emphasized that the 
process by which cement hardens is not one of drying, but rather of hydration in 
which water actually participates in a chemical bonding reaction. 

Portland cement is termed a hydraulic cement because its hardness develops by 
chemical reactions with water. It is used primarily in mortar and concrete to bind 
aggregates of inert particles (sand and/or gravel) into a cohesive mass; these are 
considered to be composite materials (see Section 16.2). Other cement materials, 
such as lime, are nonhydraulic; that is, compounds other than water (e.g., C0 2 ) are 
involved in the hardening reaction.

13.8 ADVANCED CERAMICS 

Although the traditional ceramics discussed previously account for the bulk of the 
production, the development of new and what are termed advanced ceramics has 
begun and will continue to establish a prominent niche in our advanced technolo¬ 
gies. In particular, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties and property combi¬ 
nations unique to ceramics have been exploited in a host of new products; some of 
these are discussed in Chapters 18,20, and 21. Furthermore, advanced ceramics are 
utilized in optical fiber communications systems, in microelectromechanical systems 
(MEMS), as ball bearings, and in applications that exploit the piezoelectric behav¬ 
ior of a number of ceramic materials. Each of these will now be discussed. 

Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) 

microelectro- Microelectromechanical systems (abbreviated MEMS ) are miniature “smart” sys- 

mechanical system terns (Section 1.5) consisting of a multitude of mechanical devices that are inte¬ 
grated with large numbers of electrical elements on a substrate of silicon. The 
mechanical components are microsensors and microactuators. Microsensors collect 
environmental information by measuring mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical, 
and/or magnetic phenomena. The microelectronic components then process this 
sensory input and subsequently render decisions that direct responses from the

microactuator devices—devices that perform such responses as positioning, moving, 
pumping, regulating, and filtering. These actuating devices include beams, pits, gears, 
motors, and membranes, which are of microscopic dimensions, on the order of mi¬ 
crons in size. Figure 13.4 is a scanning electron micrograph of a linear rack gear re¬ 
duction drive MEMS. 

The processing of MEMS is virtually the same as that used for the production 
of silicon-based integrated circuits; this includes photolithographic, ion implanta¬ 
tion, etching, and deposition technologies, which are well established. In addition, 
some mechanical components are fabricated using micromachining techniques. 
MEMS components are very sophisticated, reliable, and minuscule in size. Further¬ 
more, because the preceding fabrication techniques involve batch operations, the 
MEMS technology is very economical and cost effective. 

There are some limitations to the use of silicon in MEMS. Silicon has a low 
fracture toughness (— 0.90 MPa Vm) and a relatively low softening temperature 
(600°C) and is highly active to the presence of water and oxygen. Consequently, re¬ 
search is currently being conducted into using ceramic materials—which are tougher, 
more refractory, and more inert—for some MEMS components, especially high¬ 
speed devices and nanoturbines. The ceramic materials being considered are amor¬ 
phous silicon carbonitrides (silicon carbide-silicon nitride alloys), which may be 
produced using metal organic precursors. In addition, fabrication of these ceramic 
MEMS will undoubtedly involve some of the traditional techniques discussed later 
in this chapter. 

One example of a practical MEMS application is an accelerometer (accelerator/ 
decelerator sensor) that is used in the deployment of air-bag systems in automo¬ 
bile crashes. For this application, the important microelectronic component is a free¬ 
standing microbeam. Compared to conventional air-bag systems, the MEMS units 
are smaller, lighter, and more reliable and are produced at a considerable cost re¬ 
duction. 

Potential MEMS applications include electronic displays, data storage units, en¬ 
ergy conversion devices, chemical detectors (for hazardous chemical and biological 
agents and drug screening), and microsystems for DNA amplification and identifica¬ 
tion. There are undoubtedly many yet unforeseen uses of this MEMS technology, which 
will have a profound impact on our society in the future; these will probably over¬ 
shadow the effects of microelectronic integrated circuits during the past three decades. 









13.8 Advanced Ceramics * 511 


optical fiber 


Optical Fibers 

One new and advanced ceramic material that is a critical component in our mod¬ 
ern optical communications systems is the optical fiber. The optical fiber is made 
of extremely high-purity silica, which must be free of even minute levels of con¬ 
taminants and other defects that absorb, scatter, and attenuate a light beam. Very 
advanced and sophisticated processing techniques have been developed to pro¬ 
duce fibers that meet the rigid restrictions required for this application. A 
discussion of optical fibers and their role in communications is provided in Sec¬ 
tion 21.14. 

Ceramic Ball Bearings 

Another new and interesting application of ceramic materials is in bearings. A bear¬ 
ing consists of balls and races that are in contact with and rub against one another 
when in use. In the past, both ball and race components traditionally have been 
made of bearing steels that are very hard and extremely corrosion resistant and 
may be polished to a very smooth surface finish. Over the past decade or so, silicon 
nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) balls have begun replacing steel balls in a number of applications, 
because several properties of Si 3 N 4 make it a more desirable material. In most in¬ 
stances races are still made of steel, because its tensile strength is superior to that 
of silicon nitride. This combination of ceramic balls and steel races is termed a hybrid 
bearing. 

Because the density of Si 3 N 4 is much less than that of steel (3.2 versus 7.8 g/cm 3 ), 
hybrid bearings weigh less than conventional ones; thus, centrifugal loading is less 
in the hybrids, with the result that they may operate at higher speeds (20% to 40% 
higher). Furthermore, the modulus of elasticity of silicon nitride is higher than for 
bearing steels (320 GPa versus about 200 GPa). Thus, the Si 3 N 4 balls are more rigid 
and experience lower deformations while in use, which leads to reductions in noise 
and vibration levels. Lifetimes for the hybrid bearings are greater than for steel 
bearings—normally three to five times as great. The longer life is a consequence of 
the higher hardness of Si 3 N 4 (75 to 80 HRC as compared to 58 to 64 HRC for bear¬ 
ing steels) and silicon nitride’s superior compressive strength (3000 MPa versus 900 
MPa), which results in lower wear rates. In addition, less heat is generated using 
the hybrid bearings, because the coefficient of friction of Si 3 N 4 is approximately 
30% that of steel; this leads to an increase in grease life. In addition, lower lubrica¬ 
tion levels are required than for the all-steel bearings. Ceramic materials are inher¬ 
ently more corrosion resistant than metal alloys; thus, the silicon nitride balls may 
be used in more corrosive environments and at higher operating temperatures. 
Finally, because Si 3 N 4 is an electrical insulator (bearing steels are much more elec¬ 
trically conductive), the ceramic bearings are immune to arcing damage. 

Some of the applications that employ these hybrid bearings include inline 
skates, bicycles, electric motors, machine tool spindles, precision medical hand tools 
(e.g., high-speed dental drills and surgical saws), and textile, food-processing, and 
chemical equipment. 

Also, all-ceramic bearings (having both ceramic races and balls) are now 
being used on a limited basis in applications requiring a high degree of corrosion 
resistance. 

Significant research has gone into the development of this silicon nitride-bearing 
material. Some of the challenges that were encountered are as follows: processing/ 
fabrication techniques to yield a pore-free material, fabrication of spherical pieces that 
require a minimum of machining, and a polishing/lapping technique to produce a 
smoother surface finish than steel balls. 


512 * Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics 


MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Piezoelectric Ceramics 


A few ceramic materials (as well as some 
polymers) exhibit the unusual phenomenon 
of piezoelectricity 1 —electric polarization 2 (i.e., an 
electric field or voltage) is induced in the ceramic 
crystal when a mechanical strain (dimensional 
change) is imposed on it. The inverse piezoelectric 
effect is also displayed by this group of materials; 
that is, a mechanical strain results from the impo¬ 
sition of an electrical field. 

Piezoelectric materials may be used as 
transducers between electrical and mechanical en¬ 
ergies. One of the early uses of piezoelectric ce¬ 
ramics was in sonar, wherein underwater objects 
(e.g., submarines) are detected and their positions 
determined using an ultrasonic emitting and re¬ 
ceiving system. A piezoelectric crystal is caused to 
oscillate by an electrical signal, which produces 
high-frequency mechanical vibrations that are 
transmitted through the water. Upon encounter¬ 


1 The piezoelectric phenomenon is described in more 
detail in Section 18.25. 

2 Electric polarization (explained in Sections 18.19 and 
18.20) is the alignment of electric dipoles (Section 2.7) 
in a common direction, which gives rise to an electric 
field that is oriented in this same direction. 


ing an object, these signals are reflected back, and 
another piezoelectric material receives this re¬ 
flected vibrational energy, which it then converts 
back into an electrical signal. Distance from the 
ultrasonic source and reflecting body is deter¬ 
mined from the elapsed time between sending and 
receiving events. 

More recently, the use of piezoelectric devices 
has grown dramatically as a consequence of in¬ 
creases in automation and consumer attraction to 
modern sophisticated gadgets. Applications that 
employ piezoelectric devices are found in the au¬ 
tomotive, computer, commercial/consumer, and 
medical sectors. Some of these applications are as 
follows: automotive—wheel balances, seat belt 
buzzers, tread-wear indicators, keyless door entry, 
and airbag sensors; computer—microactuators for 
hard disks and notebook transformers; commer¬ 
cial/consumer—ink-jet printing heads, strain 
gauges, ultrasonic welders, and smoke detectors; 
medical—insulin pumps, ultrasonic therapy, and 
ultrasonic cataract-removal devices. 

Commonly used piezoelectric ceramics include 
barium titanate (BaTi0 3 ), lead titanate (PbTi0 3 ), 
lead zirconate-titanate (PZT) [Pb(Zr,Ti)0 3 ], and 
potassium niobate (KNb0 3 ). 


Fabrication and Processing 
of Ceramics 

One chief concern in the application of ceramic materials is the method of fab¬ 
rication. Many of the metal-forming operations discussed in Chapter 11 rely on 
casting and/or techniques that involve some form of plastic deformation. Because 
ceramic materials have relatively high melting temperatures, casting them is nor¬ 
mally impractical. Furthermore, in most instances the brittleness of these mate¬ 
rials precludes deformation. Some ceramic pieces are formed from powders (or 
particulate collections) that must ultimately be dried and fired. Glass shapes are 
formed at elevated temperatures from a fluid mass that becomes very viscous 
upon cooling. Cements are shaped by placing into forms a fluid paste that hard¬ 
ens and assumes a permanent set by virtue of chemical reactions. A taxonomi- 
cal scheme for the several types of ceramic-forming techniques is presented in 
Figure 13.5.

13.9 FABRICATION AND PROCESSING OF 
GLASSES AND GLASS-CERAMICS 

Glass Properties 

Before we discuss specific glass-forming techniques, some of the temperature-sensitive 
properties of glass materials must be presented. Glassy, or noncrystalline, materials 
do not solidify in the same sense as do those that are crystalline. Upon cooling, a 
glass becomes more and more viscous in a continuous manner with decreasing tem¬ 
perature; there is no definite temperature at which the liquid transforms to a solid 
as with crystalline materials. In fact, one of the distinctions between crystalline and 
noncrystalline materials lies in the dependence of specific volume (or volume per 
unit mass, the reciprocal of density) on temperature, as illustrated in Figure 13.6.

For crystalline materials, there is a discontinuous decrease in volume at the melt¬ 
ing temperature T m . However, for glassy materials, volume decreases continuously 
with temperature reduction; a slight decrease in slope of the curve occurs at what 
is called the glass transition temperature, or fictive temperature, T g . Below this 
temperature, the material is considered to be a glass; above, it is first a supercooled 
liquid, and finally a liquid. 

Also important in glass-forming operations are the viscosity-temperature char¬ 
acteristics of the glass. Figure 13.7 plots the logarithm of viscosity versus the tem¬ 
perature for fused silica, high silica, borosilicate, and soda-lime glasses. On the 
viscosity scale, several specific points that are important in the fabrication and pro¬ 
cessing of glasses are labeled: 

1. The melting point corresponds to the temperature at which the viscosity is 
10 Pa-s (100 P); the glass is fluid enough to be considered a liquid. 

2. The working point represents the temperature at which the viscosity is 
10 3 Pa-s (10 4 P); the glass is easily deformed at this viscosity. 

3. The softening point, the temperature at which the viscosity is 4 X 10 6 Pa-s 
(4 X 10 7 P), is the maximum temperature at which a glass piece may be 
handled without causing significant dimensional alterations. 

4. The annealing point is the temperature at which the viscosity is 10 12 Pa-s 
(10 13 P); at this temperature, atomic diffusion is sufficiently rapid that any 
residual stresses may be removed within about 15 min. 

5. The strain point corresponds to the temperature at which the viscosity be¬ 
comes 3 X 10 13 Pa-s (3 X 10 14 P); for temperatures below the strain point, 
fracture will occur before the onset of plastic deformation. The glass transi¬ 
tion temperature will be above the strain point.

Most glass-forming operations are carried out within the working range— 
between the working and softening temperatures. 

Of course, the temperature at which each of these points occurs depends on 
glass composition. For example, the softening points for soda-lime and 96% silica 
glasses from Figure 13.7 are about 700 and 1550°C (1300 and 2825°F), respectively. 
That is, forming operations may be carried out at significantly lower temperatures 
for the soda-lime glass. The formability of a glass is tailored to a large degree by 
its composition. 

Glass Forming 

Glass is produced by heating the raw materials to an elevated temperature above 
which melting occurs. Most commercial glasses are of the silica-soda-lime variety; 
the silica is usually supplied as common quartz sand, whereas Na 2 0 and CaO are 
added as soda ash (Na 2 C0 3 ) and limestone (CaC0 3 ). For most applications, espe¬ 
cially when optical transparency is important, it is essential that the glass product 
be homogeneous and pore free. Homogeneity is achieved by complete melting and 
mixing of the raw ingredients. Porosity results from small gas bubbles that are pro¬ 
duced; these must be absorbed into the melt or otherwise eliminated, which requires 
proper adjustment of the viscosity of the molten material. 

Five different forming methods are used to fabricate glass products: pressing, 
blowing, drawing, and sheet and fiber forming. Pressing is used in the fabrication 
of relatively thick-walled pieces such as plates and dishes. The glass piece is formed 
by pressure application in a graphite-coated cast iron mold having the desired shape; 
the mold is ordinarily heated to ensure an even surface. 

Although some glass blowing is done by hand, especially for art objects, the 
process has been completely automated for the production of glass jars, bottles, and 
light bulbs. The several steps involved in one such technique are illustrated in 
Figure 13.8. From a raw gob of glass, a parison, or temporary shape, is formed by

mechanical pressing in a mold. This piece is inserted into a finishing or blow mold 
and forced to conform to the mold contours by the pressure created from a blast of air. 

Drawing is used to form long glass pieces such as sheet, rod, tubing, and fibers, 
which have a constant cross section. 

Up until the late 1950s, sheet glass (or plate) was produced by casting (or draw¬ 
ing) the glass into a plate shape, grinding both faces to make them flat and paral¬ 
lel, and finally, polishing the faces to make the sheet transparent—a procedure that 
was relatively expensive. A more economical float process was patented in 1959 in 
England. With this technique (represented schematically in Figure 13.9), the molten 
glass passes (on rollers) from one furnace onto a bath of liquid tin located in a sec¬ 
ond furnace. Thus, as this continuous glass ribbon “floats” on the surface of the 
molten tin, gravitational and surface tension forces cause the faces to become 
perfectly flat and parallel and the resulting sheet to be of uniform thickness. 
Furthermore, sheet faces acquire a bright “fire-polished” finish in one region of 
the furnace. The sheet next passes into an annealing furnace (lehr), and is finally 
cut into sections (Figure 13.9). Of course, the success of this operation requires rigid 
control of both temperature and chemistry of the gaseous atmosphere. 

Continuous glass fibers are formed in a rather sophisticated drawing operation. 
The molten glass is contained in a platinum heating chamber. Fibers are formed by 
drawing the molten glass through many small orifices at the chamber base. The glass 
viscosity, which is critical, is controlled by chamber and orifice temperatures. 

Heat-Treating Glasses 

Annealing 

When a ceramic material is cooled from an elevated temperature, internal stresses, 
called thermal stresses, may be introduced as a result of the difference in cooling 
rate and thermal contraction between the surface and interior regions. These ther¬ 
mal stresses are important in brittle ceramics, especially glasses, because they may 
thermal shock weaken the material or, in extreme cases, lead to fracture, which is termed thermal 

shock (see Section 19.5). Normally, attempts are made to avoid thermal stresses, 
which may be accomplished by cooling the piece at a sufficiently slow rate. Once 
such stresses have been introduced, however, elimination, or at least a reduction in 
their magnitude, is possible by an annealing heat treatment in which the glassware 
is heated to the annealing point, then slowly cooled to room temperature.

Glass Tempering 

The strength of a glass piece may be enhanced by intentionally inducing compres¬ 
sive residual surface stresses. This can be accomplished by a heat treatment proce- 
thermal tempering dure called thermal tempering. With this technique, the glassware is heated to a 
temperature above the glass transition region yet below the softening point. It is 
then cooled to room temperature in a jet of air or, in some cases, an oil bath. The 
residual stresses arise from differences in cooling rates for surface and interior re¬ 
gions. Initially, the surface cools more rapidly and, once it has dropped to a tem¬ 
perature below the strain point, becomes rigid. At this time, the interior, having 
cooled less rapidly, is at a higher temperature (above the strain point) and, there¬ 
fore, is still plastic. With continued cooling, the interior attempts to contract to a 
greater degree than the now-rigid exterior will allow. Thus, the inside tends to draw 
in the outside, or to impose inward radial stresses. As a consequence, after the glass 
piece has cooled to room temperature, it sustains compressive stresses on the sur¬ 
face, with tensile stresses at interior regions. The room-temperature stress distribu¬ 
tion over a cross section of a glass plate is represented schematically in Figure 13.10. 

The failure of ceramic materials almost always results from a crack that is ini¬ 
tiated at the surface by an applied tensile stress. To cause fracture of a tempered 
glass piece, the magnitude of an externally applied tensile stress must be great 
enough to first overcome the residual compressive surface stress and, in addition, 
to stress the surface in tension sufficient to initiate a crack, which may then prop¬ 
agate. For an untempered glass, a crack will be introduced at a lower external stress 
level, and, consequently, the fracture strength will be smaller. 

Tempered glass is used for applications in which high strength is important; 
these include large doors and eyeglass lenses.

Fabrication and Heat-Treating of Glass-Ceramics 

The first stage in the fabrication of a glass-ceramic ware is forming it into the de¬ 
sired shape as a glass. Forming techniques used are the same as for glass pieces, as 
described previously—e.g., pressing and drawing. Conversion of the glass into a 
glass-ceramic (i.e., crystallation, Section 13.3) is accomplished by appropriate heat 
treatments. One such set of heat treatments for a Li 2 0 -Al 2 03 -Si 02 glass-ceramic 
is detailed in the time-versus-temperature plot of Figure 13.11. After melting and 
forming operations, nucleation and growth of the crystalline phase particles are car¬ 
ried out isothermally at two different temperatures. 

13.10 FABRICATION AND PROCESSING 
OF CLAY PRODUCTS 

As Section 13.4 noted, this class of materials includes the structural clay products 
and the whitewares. In addition to clay, many of these products also contain other 
ingredients. After being formed, pieces most often must be subjected to drying and 
firing operations; each of the ingredients influences the changes that take place dur¬ 
ing these processes and the characteristics of the finished piece. 

The Characteristics of Clay 

The clay minerals play two very important roles in ceramic bodies. First, when 
water is added, they become very plastic, a condition termed hydroplasticity. This 
property is very important in forming operations, as discussed shortly. In addition, 
clay fuses or melts over a range of temperatures; thus, a dense and strong ceramic 
piece may be produced during firing without complete melting such that the de¬ 
sired shape is maintained. This fusion temperature range, of course, depends on the 
composition of the clay. 

Clays are aluminosilicates, being composed of alumina (A1 2 0 3 ) and silica 
(Si0 2 ), that contain chemically bound water. They have a broad range of physi¬ 
cal characteristics, chemical compositions, and structures; common impurities in¬ 
clude compounds (usually oxides) of barium, calcium, sodium, potassium, and iron, 
and also some organic matter. Crystal structures for the clay minerals are rela¬ 
tively complicated; however, one prevailing characteristic is a layered structure. 










13.10 Fabrication and Processing of Clay Products * 519 


hydroplastic forming 
slip casting 


The most common clay minerals that are of interest have what is called the kaoli- 
nite structure. Kaolinite clay [Al2(Si 2 0 5 )(0H)4] has the crystal structure shown in 
Figure 12.14. When water is added, the water molecules fit between these layered 
sheets and form a thin film around the clay particles. The particles are thus free 
to move over one another, which accounts for the resulting plasticity of the 
water-clay mixture. 

Compositions of Clay Products 

In addition to clay, many of these products (in particular the whitewares) also con¬ 
tain some nonplastic ingredients; the nonclay minerals include flint, or finely ground 
quartz, and a flux such as feldspar. 3 The quartz is used primarily as a filler material, 
being inexpensive, relatively hard, and chemically unreactive. It experiences little 
change during high-temperature heat treatment because it has a melting tempera¬ 
ture well above the normal firing temperature; when melted, however, quartz has 
the ability to form a glass. 

When mixed with clay, a flux forms a glass that has a relatively low melting 
point. The feldspars are some of the more common fluxing agents; they are a group 
of aluminosilicate materials that contain K + , Na + , and Ca 2+ ions. 

As would be expected, the changes that take place during drying and firing 
processes, and also the characteristics of the finished piece, are influenced by the 
proportions of these three constituents: clay, quartz, and flux. A typical porcelain 
might contain approximately 50% clay, 25% quartz, and 25% feldspar. 

Fabrication Techniques 

The as-mined raw materials usually have to go through a milling or grinding oper¬ 
ation in which particle size is reduced; this is followed by screening or sizing to yield 
a powdered product having a desired range of particle sizes. For multicomponent 
systems, powders must be thoroughly mixed with water and perhaps other ingredi¬ 
ents to give flow characteristics that are compatible with the particular forming tech¬ 
nique. The formed piece must have sufficient mechanical strength to remain intact 
during transporting, drying, and firing operations. Two common shaping techniques 
are used to form clay-based compositions: hydroplastic forming and slip casting. 

Hydroplastic Forming 

As mentioned previously, clay minerals, when mixed with water, become highly plas¬ 
tic and pliable and may be molded without cracking; however, they have extremely 
low yield strengths. The consistency (water-clay ratio) of the hydroplastic mass must 
give a yield strength sufficient to permit a formed ware to maintain its shape dur¬ 
ing handling and drying. 

The most common hydroplastic forming technique is extrusion, in which a stiff 
plastic ceramic mass is forced through a die orifice having the desired cross-sectional 
geometry; it is similar to the extrusion of metals (Figure 11.8c). Brick, pipe, ceramic 
blocks, and tiles are all commonly fabricated using hydroplastic forming. Usually 
the plastic ceramic is forced through the die by means of a motor-driven auger, and 
often air is removed in a vacuum chamber to enhance the density. Hollow internal 
columns in the extruded piece (e.g., building brick) are formed by inserts situated 
within the die. 


3 Flux, in the context of clay products, is a substance that promotes the formation of a 
glassy phase during the firing heat treatment.

Slip poured 



(b) 


Slip Casting 

Another forming process used for clay-based compositions is slip casting. A slip 
is a suspension of clay and/or other nonplastic materials in water. When poured 
into a porous mold (commonly made of plaster of paris), water from the slip is 
absorbed into the mold, leaving behind a solid layer on the mold wall, the thick¬ 
ness of which depends on the time. This process may be continued until the en¬ 
tire mold cavity becomes solid (solid casting ), as demonstrated in Figure 13.12a. 
Or it may be terminated when the solid shell wall reaches the desired thickness, 
by inverting the mold and pouring out the excess slip; this is termed drain casting 
(Figure 13.12 b). As the cast piece dries and shrinks, it will pull away (or release) 
from the mold wall; at this time the mold may be disassembled and the cast piece 
removed. 

The nature of the slip is extremely important; it must have a high specific grav¬ 
ity and yet be very fluid and pourable. These characteristics depend on the solid- 
to-water ratio and other agents that are added. A satisfactory casting rate is an 
essential requirement. In addition, the cast piece must be free of bubbles, and it 
must have a low drying shrinkage and a relatively high strength. 

The properties of the mold itself influence the quality of the casting. Normally, 
plaster of paris, which is economical, relatively easy to fabricate into intricate shapes, 
and reusable, is used as the mold material. Most molds are multipiece items that 
must be assembled before casting. Also, the mold porosity may be varied to con¬ 
trol the casting rate. The rather complex ceramic shapes that may be produced by 
means of slip casting include sanitary lavatory ware, art objects, and specialized sci¬ 
entific laboratory ware such as ceramic tubes.

green ceramic body 


Drying and Firing 

A ceramic piece that has been formed hydroplastically or by slip casting retains sig¬ 
nificant porosity and insufficient strength for most practical applications. In addition, 
it may still contain some liquid (e.g., water), which was added to assist in the form¬ 
ing operation. This liquid is removed in a drying process; density and strength are 
enhanced as a result of a high-temperature heat treatment or firing procedure. A body 
that has been formed and dried but not fired is termed green. Drying and firing tech¬ 
niques are critical inasmuch as defects that ordinarily render the ware useless (e.g., 
warpage, distortion, and cracks) may be introduced during the operation. These 
defects normally result from stresses that are set up from nonuniform shrinkage. 

Drying 

As a clay-based ceramic body dries, it also experiences some shrinkage. In the early 
stages of drying, the clay particles are virtually surrounded by and separated from 
one another by a thin film of water. As drying progresses and water is removed, the 
interparticle separation decreases, which is manifested as shrinkage (Figure 13.13). 
During drying it is critical to control the rate of water removal. Drying at interior 
regions of a body is accomplished by the diffusion of water molecules to the sur¬ 
face, where evaporation occurs. If the rate of evaporation is greater than the rate 
of diffusion, the surface will dry (and as a consequence shrink) more rapidly than 
the interior, with a high probability of the formation of the aforementioned defects. 
The rate of surface evaporation should be diminished to, at most, the rate of water 
diffusion; evaporation rate may be controlled by temperature, humidity, and the rate 
of airflow. 

Other factors also influence shrinkage. One of these is body thickness; nonuni¬ 
form shrinkage and defect formation are more pronounced in thick pieces than in 
thin ones. Water content of the formed body is also critical: the greater the water 
content, the more extensive the shrinkage. Consequently, the water content is ordi¬ 
narily kept as low as possible. Clay particle size also has an influence; shrinkage is 
enhanced as the particle size is decreased. To minimize shrinkage, the size of the 
particles may be increased, or nonplastic materials having relatively large particles 
may be added to the clay. 

Microwave energy may also be used to dry ceramic wares. One advantage of 
this technique is that the high temperatures used in conventional methods are 
avoided; drying temperatures may be kept to below 50°C (120°F). This is important 
because the drying of some temperature-sensitive materials should be kept as low 
as possible.

vitrification 


Check 13.5 

Thick ceramic wares are more likely to crack upon drying than thin wares. Why is 
this so? 

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 



Firing 

After drying, a body is usually fired at a temperature between 900 and 1400°C (1650 
and 2550°F); the firing temperature depends on the composition and desired proper¬ 
ties of the finished piece. During the firing operation, the density is further increased 
(with an attendant decrease in porosity) and the mechanical strength is enhanced. 

When clay-based materials are heated to elevated temperatures, some rather com¬ 
plex and involved reactions occur. One of these is vitrification, the gradual forma¬ 
tion of a liquid glass that flows into and fills some of the pore volume. The degree of 
vitrification depends on firing temperature and time, as well as the composition of the 
body. The temperature at which the liquid phase forms is lowered by the addition of 
fluxing agents such as feldspar. This fused phase flows around the remaining unmelted 
particles and fills in the pores as a result of surface tension forces (or capillary action); 
shrinkage also accompanies this process. Upon cooling, this fused phase forms a glassy 
matrix that results in a dense, strong body. Thus, the final microstructure consists of 
the vitrified phase, any unreacted quartz particles, and some porosity. Figure 13.14 is

The degree of vitrification, of course, controls the room-temperature proper¬ 
ties of the ceramic ware; strength, durability, and density are all enhanced as it in¬ 
creases. The firing temperature determines the extent to which vitrification occurs; 
that is, vitrification increases as the firing temperature is raised. Building bricks are 
ordinarily fired around 900°C (1650°F) and are relatively porous. On the other hand, 
firing of highly vitrified porcelain, which borders on being optically translucent, 
takes place at much higher temperatures. Complete vitrification is avoided during 
firing, because a body becomes too soft and will collapse.

POWDER PRESSING 

Several ceramic-forming techniques have already been discussed relative to the fab¬ 
rication of glass and clay products. Another important and commonly used method 
that warrants a brief treatment is powder pressing. Powder pressing, the ceramic 
analogue to powder metallurgy, is used to fabricate both clay and nonclay compo¬ 
sitions, including electronic and magnetic ceramics as well as some refractory brick 
products. In essence, a powdered mass, usually containing a small amount of water 
or other binder, is compacted into the desired shape by pressure. The degree of 
compaction is maximized and the fraction of void space is minimized by using coarse 
and fine particles mixed in appropriate proportions. There is no plastic deforma¬ 
tion of the particles during compaction, as there may be with metal powders. One 
function of the binder is to lubricate the powder particles as they move past one 
another in the compaction process. 

There are three basic powder-pressing procedures: uniaxial, isostatic (or hydro¬ 
static), and hot pressing. For uniaxial pressing, the powder is compacted in a metal 
die by pressure that is applied in a single direction. The formed piece takes on the 
configuration of the die and platens through which the pressure is applied. This 
method is confined to shapes that are relatively simple; however, production rates 
are high and the process is inexpensive. The steps involved in one technique are 
illustrated in Figure 13.15. 

For isostatic pressing, the powdered material is contained in a rubber enve¬ 
lope and the pressure is applied by a fluid, isostatically (i.e., it has the same mag¬ 
nitude in all directions). More complicated shapes are possible than with uniaxial 
pressing; however, the isostatic technique is more time consuming and expensive. 

For both uniaxial and isostatic procedures, a firing operation is required af¬ 
ter the pressing operation. During firing the formed piece shrinks and experiences 
a reduction of porosity and an improvement in mechanical integrity. These changes 
occur by the coalescence of the powder particles into a more dense mass in a 
process termed sintering. The mechanism of sintering is schematically illustrated 
in Figure 13.16. After pressing, many of the powder particles touch one another 
(Figure 13.16a). During the initial sintering stage, necks form along the contact 
regions between adjacent particles; in addition, a grain boundary forms within

each neck, and every interstice between particles becomes a pore (Figure 13.1 6b). 
As sintering progresses, the pores become smaller and more spherical in shape 
(Figure 13.16c). A scanning electron micrograph of a sintered alumina material is 
shown in Figure 13.17. The driving force for sintering is the reduction in total par¬ 
ticle surface area; surface energies are larger in magnitude than grain boundary 
energies. Sintering is carried out below the melting temperature so that a liquid 
phase is normally not present. Mass transport necessary to effect the changes 
shown in Figure 13.16 is accomplished by atomic diffusion from the bulk parti¬ 
cles to the neck regions. 

With hot pressing, the powder pressing and heat treatment are performed 
simultaneously—the powder aggregate is compacted at an elevated temperature. 
The procedure is used for materials that do not form a liquid phase except at very 
high and impractical temperatures; in addition, it is used when high densities with¬ 
out appreciable grain growth are desired. This is an expensive fabrication technique 
that has some limitations. It is costly in terms of time, because both mold and die 
must be heated and cooled during each cycle. In addition, the mold is usually ex¬ 
pensive to fabricate and ordinarily has a short lifetime. 

13.12 TAPE CASTING 

An important ceramic fabrication technique, tape casting, will now be briefly dis¬ 
cussed. As the name implies, thin sheets of a flexible tape are produced by means 
of a casting process. These sheets are prepared from slips, in many respects similar 
to those that are employed for slip casting (Section 13.10). This type of slip consists 
of a suspension of ceramic particles in an organic liquid that also contains binders 
and plasticizers that are incorporated to impart strength and flexibility to the cast 
tape. De-airing in a vacuum may also be necessary to remove any entrapped air or 
solvent vapor bubbles, which may act as crack-initiation sites in the finished piece. 
The actual tape is formed by pouring the slip onto a flat surface (of stainless steel, 
glass, a polymeric film, or paper); a doctor blade spreads the slip into a thin tape of

uniform thickness, as shown schematically in Figure 13.18. In the drying process, 
volatile slip components are removed by evaporation; this green product is a flex¬ 
ible tape that may be cut or into which holes may be punched prior to a firing op¬ 
eration. Tape thicknesses normally range between 0.1 and 2 mm (0.004 and 0.08 
in.). Tape casting is widely used in the production of ceramic substrates that are 
used for integrated circuits and for multilayered capacitors. 

Cementation is also considered a ceramic fabrication process (Figure 13.5). The 
cement material, when mixed with water, forms a paste that, after being fashioned 
into a desired shape, subsequently hardens as a result of complex chemical reac¬ 
tions. Cements and the cementation process were discussed briefly in Section 13.7. 


SUMMARY 


Glasses 

• The familiar glass materials are noncrystalline silicates that contain other oxides. 
In addition to silica (Si0 2 ), the two other primary ingredients of a typical 
soda-lime glass are soda (Na 2 0) and lime (CaO). 

• The two prime assets of glass materials are optical transparency and ease of 
fabrication. 

Glass-Ceramics 

• Glass-ceramics are initially fabricated as glasses, and then, by heat treatment, crys¬ 
tallized to form fine-grained polycrystalline materials. 

• Two properties of glass-ceramics that make them superior to glass are improved 
mechanical strengths and lower coefficients of thermal expansion (which im¬ 
proves thermal shock resistance). 

Clay Products 

• Clay is the principal component of the whitewares (e.g., pottery and tableware) 
and structural clay products (e.g., building bricks and tiles). Ingredients (in addi¬ 
tion to clay) may be added, such as feldspar and quartz; these influence changes 
that occur during firing. 

Refractories 

• Materials that are employed at elevated temperatures and often in reactive en¬ 
vironments are termed refractory ceramics. 






Summary * 527 


• Requirements for this class of materials include high melting temperature, the 
ability to remain unreactive and inert when exposed to severe environments (of¬ 
ten at elevated temperatures), and the ability to provide thermal insulation. 

• On the basis of composition and application, the four main subdivisions are fire¬ 
clay (alumina-silica mixtures), silica (high silica contents), basic (rich in magnesia, 
MgO), and special. 

Abrasives 

• The abrasive ceramics are used to cut, grind, and polish other softer materials. 

• This group of materials must be hard and tough and be able to withstand high 
temperatures that arise from frictional forces. 

• Diamond, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, corundum, and silica sand are the 
most common abrasive materials. 

Cements 

• Portland cement is produced by heating a mixture of clay and lime-bearing min¬ 
erals in a rotary kiln. The resulting “clinker” is ground into very fine particles to 
which a small amount of gypsum is added. 

• When mixed with water, inorganic cements form a paste that is capable of as¬ 
suming just about any desired shape. 

• Subsequent setting or hardening is a result of chemical reactions involving the 
cement particles and occurs at the ambient temperature. For hydraulic cements, 
of which portland cement is the most common, the chemical reaction is one of 
hydration. 

Advanced Ceramics 

• Many of our modern technologies use and will continue to use advanced ceram¬ 
ics because of their unique mechanical, chemical, electrical, magnetic, and opti¬ 
cal properties and property combinations. 

Piezoelectric ceramics—generate electric fields when mechanical strains (i.e., 
dimensional changes) are imposed. 

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) —smart systems that consist of 
miniaturized mechanical devices integrated with electrical elements on a 
substrate (normally silicon). 

Ceramic ball bearings—for some bearing applications, bearing steel balls are 
being replaced by Si 3 N 4 balls. Silicon nitride is harder and less dense and 
has a higher compressive strength than bearing steels. 

Fabrication and Processing of Glasses and Glass-Ceramics 

• Because glasses are formed at elevated temperatures, the temperature-viscosity 
behavior is an important consideration. Melting, working, softening, annealing, and 
strain points represent temperatures that correspond to specific viscosity values. 

• Four of the more common glass-forming techniques are the following: pressing, 
blowing (Figure 13.8), drawing (Figure 13.9), and fiber forming. 

• When glass pieces are cooled, internal thermal stresses may be generated because 
of differences in cooling rate (and degrees of thermal contraction) between in¬ 
terior and surfaces regions. 

• After fabrication, glasses may be annealed and/or tempered to improve mecha¬ 
nical characteristics. 


528 * Chapter 13 / Applications and Processing of Ceramics 


Fabrication and Processing of Clay Products 

• Clay minerals assume two roles in the fabrication of ceramic bodies: 

When water is added to clay it becomes pliable and amenable to forming. 
Clay minerals melt over a range of temperatures; thus, during firing, a dense 
and strong piece is produced without complete melting. 

• For clay products, two common fabrication techniques are hydroplastic forming 
and slip casting. 

For hydroplastic forming, a plastic and pliable mass is formed into a desired 
shape by forcing the mass through a die orifice. 

With slip casting, a slip (suspension of clay and other minerals in water) is 
poured into a porous mold. As water is absorbed into the mold, a solid 
layer is deposited on the inside of the mold wall. 

• After forming, a clay-based body must be first dried and then fired at an elevated 
temperature to reduce porosity and enhance strength. 

Powder Pressing 

• Some ceramic pieces are formed by powder compaction; uniaxial, isostatic, and 
hot pressing techniques are possible. 

• Densification of pressed pieces takes place by a sintering mechanism (Figure 
13.16) during a high-temperature firing procedure. 

Tape Casting 

• With tape casting, a thin sheet of ceramic of uniform thickness is formed from a 
slip that is spread onto a flat surface using a doctor blade (Figure 13.18). This 
tape is then subjected to drying and firing operations. 

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

In this chapter we discussed the manner in which the viscosity of a glass is influ¬ 
enced by both composition and temperature (Figure 13.7). This information is im¬ 
portant inasmuch as the ability of a glass to melt and be formed is a function of its 
viscosity. 

Furthermore, the role of continuous cooling transformation diagrams in the 
heat treatment and control of microstructure was presented (for iron-carbon alloys) 
in Chapter 10. We also discussed how this type of diagram is employed in design¬ 
ing heat treatments to crystallize glass-ceramics. The following schematics represent 
relationships for these processing procedures.

Summary * 529 


This chapter also discussed the structural transformation that occurs during 
crystallization—from a glassy (noncrystalline) structure (Chapters 3 and 12) to a 
fine-grained polycrystalline one, as represented by the following relational diagram.

Property alterations are also possible as a result of crystallization. The glass- 
ceramic piece may remain transparent (as the precursor glass) or become opaque, 
depending on grain size. Very fine-grained materials are transparent, as discussed 
in Section 21.10. The following diagram depicts this relationship.

relationships shown above are conceptual in nature—that is, they represent the sci¬ 
entific (as opposed to engineering) aspects of materials. We have also generated a

WHY STUDY Polymer Structures? 


A relatively large number of chemical and structural 
characteristics affect the properties and behaviors of 
polymeric materials. Some of these influences are as 
follows: 

1. Degree of crystallinity of semicrystallme polymers— 
on density, stiffness, strength, and ductility (Sections 
14.11 and 15.8). 

2. Degree of crosslinking—on the stiffness of rubberlike 
materials (Section 15.9). 

3. Polymer chemistry—on melting and glass-transition 
temperatures (Section 15.14). 


In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme for polymer fibers, the reason for studying 
polymer structures is as follows: 

• In this chapter we explore the various structural 
elements of polymers, the concepts of crystallinity 
and crystals in polymers, and how degree of 
crystallinity is influenced by these structural 
elements. The manner in which the structural 
elements affect the properties of polymer fibers is 
discussed in Chapter 15. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe a typical polymer molecule in terms of 
its chain structure and, in addition, how the 
molecule may be generated from repeat units. 

2. Draw repeat units for polyethylene, poly(vinyl 
chloride), polytetrafluoroethylene, polypropyl¬ 
ene, and polystyrene. 

3. Calculate number-average and weight-average 
molecular weights and degree of polymerization 
for a specified polymer. 

4. Name and briefly describe: 

(a) the four general types of polymer molecular 
structures. 


(b) the three types of stereoisomers, 

(c) the two kinds of geometrical isomers, and 

(d) the four types of copolymers. 

5. Cite the differences in behavior and molecular 
structure for thermoplastic and thermosetting 
polymers. 

6. Briefly describe the crystalline state in polymeric 
materials. 

7. Briefly describe/diagram the spherulitic structure 
for a semicrystalline polymer. 


14.1 INTRODUCTION 

Naturally occurring polymers—those derived from plants and animals—have been 
used for many centuries; these materials include wood, rubber, cotton, wool, 
leather, and silk. Other natural polymers such as proteins, enzymes, starches, and 
cellulose are important in biological and physiological processes in plants and 
animals. Modern scientific research tools have made possible the determination of 
the molecular structures of this group of materials, and the development of nu¬ 
merous polymers, which are synthesized from small organic molecules. Many of 
our useful plastics, rubbers, and fiber materials are synthetic polymers. In fact, since 
the conclusion of World War II, the field of materials has been virtually revolu¬ 
tionized by the advent of synthetic polymers. The synthetics can be produced 
inexpensively, and their properties may be managed to the degree that many are 
superior to their natural counterparts. In some applications metal and wood parts 
have been replaced by plastics, which have satisfactory properties and may be 
produced at a lower cost.

534 • Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures 


As with metals and ceramics, the properties of polymers are intricately related 
to the structural elements of the material. This chapter explores molecular and crys¬ 
tal structures of polymers; Chapter 15 discusses the relationships between structure 
and some of the physical and chemical properties, along with typical applications 
and forming methods. 


14.2 HYDROCARBON MOLECULES 

Because most polymers are organic in origin, we briefly review some of the basic 
concepts relating to the structure of their molecules. First, many organic materials 
are hydrocarbons; that is, they are composed of hydrogen and carbon. Furthermore, 
the intramolecular bonds are covalent. Each carbon atom has four electrons that 
may participate in covalent bonding, whereas every hydrogen atom has only one 
bonding electron. A single covalent bond exists when each of the two bonding atoms 
contributes one electron, as represented schematically in Figure 2.10 for a molecule 
of methane (CH 4 ). Double and triple bonds between two carbon atoms involve the 
sharing of two and three pairs of electrons, respectively. For example, in ethylene, 
which has the chemical formula C 2 H 4 , the two carbon atoms are doubly bonded to¬ 
gether, and each is also singly bonded to two hydrogen atoms, as represented by the 
structural formula 


H H 


C = C 


H H 

where — and = denote single and double covalent bonds, respectively. An example 
of a triple bond is found in acetylene, C 2 H 2 : 

H—C=C—H 

unsaturated Molecules that have double and triple covalent bonds are termed unsaturated. 

That is, each carbon atom is not bonded to the maximum (four) other atoms; there¬ 
fore, it is possible for another atom or group of atoms to become attached to the 
saturated original molecule. Furthermore, for a saturated hydrocarbon, all bonds are single 

ones, and no new atoms may be joined without the removal of others that are already 
bonded. 

Some of the simple hydrocarbons belong to the paraffin family; the chainlike 
paraffin molecules include methane (CH 4 ), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), propane (C 3 H 8 ), and 
butane (C 4 H 10 ). Compositions and molecular structures for paraffin molecules are 
contained in Table 14.1. The covalent bonds in each molecule are strong, but only 
weak hydrogen and van der Waals bonds exist between molecules, and thus these 
hydrocarbons have relatively low melting and boiling points. However, boiling tem¬ 
peratures rise with increasing molecular weight (Table 14.1). 

Hydrocarbon compounds with the same composition may have different atomic 
isomerism arrangements, a phenomenon termed isomerism. For example, there are two isomers 

for butane; normal butane has the structure

Some of the physical properties of hydrocarbons will depend on the isomeric state; 
for example, the boiling temperatures for normal butane and isobutane are -0.5 
and — 12.3°C (31.1 and 9.9°F), respectively. 

There are numerous other organic groups, many of which are involved in poly¬ 
mer structures. Several of the more common groups are presented in Table 14.2, 
where R and R' represent organic groups such as CH 3 , C 2 H 5 , and C 6 H 5 (methyl, 
ethyl, and phenyl).

14.3 POLYMER MOLECULES 

The molecules in polymers are gigantic in comparison to the hydrocarbon molecules 
macromolecule already discussed; because of their size they are often referred to as macromolecules. 

Within each molecule, the atoms are bound together by covalent interatomic bonds.

For carbon chain polymers, the backbone of each chain is a string of carbon atoms. 
Many times each carbon atom singly bonds to two adjacent carbon atoms on either 
side, represented schematically in two dimensions as follows: 

i i i i i i i 

—c—c—c—c—c—c—c— 

I I I I I I I 

Each of the two remaining valence electrons for every carbon atom may be in¬ 
volved in side bonding with atoms or radicals that are positioned adjacent to the 
chain. Of course, both chain and side double bonds are also possible. 

These long molecules are composed of structural entities called repeat units, 
which are successively repeated along the chain. 1 The term monomer refers to the 
small molecule from which a polymer is synthesized. Hence, monomer and repeat 
unit mean different things, but sometimes the term monomer or monomer unit is 
used instead of the more proper term repeat unit. 


1 A repeat unit is also sometimes called a mer. Mer originates from the Greek word 
meros, which means “part”; the term polymer was coined to mean “many mers.” 






14.4 The Chemistry of Polymer Molecules * 537 


14.4 THE CHEMISTRY OF POLYMER MOLECULES 

Consider again the hydrocarbon ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), which is a gas at ambient tem¬ 
perature and pressure and has the following molecular structure: 


C=C

H H 

If the ethylene gas is reacted under appropriate conditions, it will transform to 
polyethylene (PE), which is a solid polymeric material. This process begins when 
an active center is formed by the reaction between an initiator or catalyst species 
(R-) and the ethylene monomer, as follows:

(14.1) 


The polymer chain then forms by the sequential addition of monomer units to this 
active growing chain molecule. The active site, or unpaired electron (denoted by •), 
is transferred to each successive end monomer as it is linked to the chain. This may 
be represented schematically as follows:

The representation in Figure 14.1a is not strictly correct in that the angle be¬

A more accurate three-dimensional model is one in which the carbon atoms form 
a zigzag pattern (Figure 14.1 b), the C—C bond length being 0.154 nm. In this

When all of the repeating units along a chain are of the same type, the result¬ 
ing polymer is called a homopolymer. Chains may be composed of two or more dif¬ 
ferent repeat units, in what are termed copolymers (see Section 14.10). 

The monomers discussed thus far have an active bond that may react to form 
two covalent bonds with other monomers forming a two-dimensional chainlike 
molecular structure, as indicated earlier for ethylene. Such a monomer is termed 
bifunctional. In general, the functionality is the number of bonds that a given 
monomer can form. For example, monomers such as phenol-formaldehyde (Table 14.3) 
are trifunctional; they have three active bonds, from which a three-dimensional 
molecular network structure results.

Concept 


14.5 MOLECULAR WEIGHT 

Extremely large molecular weights 4 are observed in polymers with very long 
chains. During the polymerization process, not all polymer chains will grow to 
the same length; this results in a distribution of chain lengths or molecular 
weights. Ordinarily, an average molecular weight is specified, which may be de¬ 
termined by the measurement of various physical properties such as viscosity and 
osmotic pressure. 

There are several ways of defining average molecular weight. The number- 
average molecular weight M n is obtained by dividing the chains into a series of size 
ranges and then determining the number fraction of chains within each size range 
(Figure 14.3a). The number-average molecular weight is expressed as 


Number-average 
molecular weight 


M n = 2 .xMi (14.5a) 

where M t represents the mean (middle) molecular weight of size range /, and x t is 
the fraction of the total number of chains within the corresponding size range. 


4 Molecular mass, molar mass , and relative molecular mass are sometimes used and are really 
more appropriate terms than molecular weight in the context of the present discussion—in ac¬ 
tual fact, we are dealing with masses and not weights. However, molecular weight is most 
commonly found in the polymer literature and thus will be used throughout this book.

Figure 14.4 Distribution of molecular 
weights for a typical polymer. 


A weight-average molecular weight M w is based on the weight fraction of mol¬ 
ecules within the various size ranges (Figure 14.36). It is calculated according to 


M w = (14.5b) 

where, again, M t is the mean molecular weight within a size range, whereas w t de¬ 
notes the weight fraction of molecules within the same size interval. Computations 
for both number-average and weight-average molecular weights are carried out in 
Example Problem 14.1. A typical molecular weight distribution along with these 
molecular weight averages is shown in Figure 14.4. 

An alternate way of expressing average chain size of a polymer is as the degree 
of polymerization, DP , which represents the average number of repeat units in a 
chain. DP is related to the number-average molecular weight M n by the equation 


DP = — 
m 


where m is the repeat unit molecular weight.

(a) The data necessary for this computation, as taken from Figure 14.3a, are 
presented in Table 14.4a. According to Equation 14.5a, summation of all the 
XfMf products (from the right-hand column) yields the number-average 
molecular weight, which in this case is 21,150 g/mol.

(b) To determine the degree of polymerization (Equation 14.6), it is first nec¬ 
essary to compute the repeat unit molecular weight. For PVC, each repeat 
unit consists of two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and a single chlo¬ 
rine atom (Table 14.3). Furthermore, the atomic weights of C, H, and Cl are, 
respectively, 12.01,1.01, and 35.45 g/mol. Thus, for PVC 

m = 2(12.01 g/mol) + 3(1.01 g/mol) + 35.45 g/mol

544 • Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures 


Many polymer properties are affected by the length of the polymer chains. For 
example, the melting or softening temperature increases with increasing molecular 
weight (for M up to about 100,000 g/mol). At room temperature, polymers with very 
short chains (having molecular weights on the order of 100 g/mol) will generally 
exist as liquids. Those with molecular weights of approximately 1000 g/mol are waxy 
solids (such as paraffin wax) and soft resins. Solid polymers (sometimes termed high 
polymers ), which are of prime interest here, commonly have molecular weights rang¬ 
ing between 10,000 and several million g/mol. Thus, the same polymer material can 
have quite different properties if it is produced with a different molecular weight. 
Other properties that depend on molecular weight include elastic modulus and 
strength (see Chapter 15). 


14.6 MOLECULAR SHAPE 

Previously, polymer molecules have been shown as linear chains, neglecting the 
zigzag arrangement of the backbone atoms (Figure 14.1 b). Single chain bonds are 
capable of rotating and bending in three dimensions. Consider the chain atoms in 
Figure 14.5a; a third carbon atom may lie at any point on the cone of revolution 
and still subtend about a 109° angle with the bond between the other two atoms. 
A straight chain segment results when successive chain atoms are positioned as 
in Figure 14.5 b. On the other hand, chain bending and twisting are possible when 
there is a rotation of the chain atoms into other positions, as illustrated in Figure 
14.5c. 5 Thus, a single chain molecule composed of many chain atoms might as¬ 
sume a shape similar to that represented schematically in Figure 14.6, having a 
multitude of bends, twists, and kinks. 6 Also indicated in this figure is the end-to- 
end distance of the polymer chain r; this distance is much smaller than the total 
chain length. 

Polymers consist of large numbers of molecular chains, each of which may bend, 
coil, and kink in the manner of Figure 14.6. This leads to extensive intertwining and 
entanglement of neighboring chain molecules, a situation similar to a heavily tangled 



Figure 14.5 Schematic representations of how polymer chain shape is influenced by 
the positioning of backbone carbon atoms (gray circles). For (a), the rightmost atom may 
lie anywhere on the dashed circle and still subtend a 109° angle with the bond between the 
other two atoms. Straight and twisted chain segments are generated when the backbone 
atoms are situated as in ( b ) and (c), respectively. (From Askeland, Science and Engineering 
of Materials, 3E. © 1994 Cengage Learning, a part of Cengage Learning, Inc. Reproduced

5 For some polymers, rotation of carbon backbone atoms within the cone may be hindered 
by bulky side group elements on neighboring chain atoms. 

6 The term conformation is often used in reference to the physical outline of a molecule, or 
molecular shape, that can be altered only by rotation of chain atoms about single bonds.

fishing line. These random coils and molecular entanglements are responsible for a 
number of important characteristics of polymers, to include the large elastic exten¬ 
sions displayed by the rubber materials. 

Some of the mechanical and thermal characteristics of polymers are a function 
of the ability of chain segments to experience rotation in response to applied stresses 
or thermal vibrations. Rotational flexibility is dependent on repeat unit structure 
and chemistry. For example, the region of a chain segment that has a double bond 
(C=C) is rotationally rigid. Also, introduction of a bulky or large side group of 
atoms restricts rotational movement. For example, polystyrene molecules, which 
have a phenyl side group (Table 14.3), are more resistant to rotational motion than 
are polyethylene chains. 


14.7 MOLECULAR STRUCTURE 

The physical characteristics of a polymer depend not only on its molecular 
weight and shape but also on differences in the structure of the molecular chains. 
Modern polymer synthesis techniques permit considerable control over various 
structural possibilities. This section discusses several molecular structures in¬ 
cluding linear, branched, crosslinked, and network, in addition to various iso¬ 
meric configurations. 

Linear Polymers 

linear polymer Linear polymers are those in which the repeat units are joined together end to end 

in single chains. These long chains are flexible and may be thought of as a mass of 
spaghetti, as represented schematically in Figure 14.7a, where each circle represents a 
repeat unit. For linear polymers, there may be extensive van der Waals and hydrogen 
bonding between the chains. Some of the common polymers that form with linear struc¬ 
tures are polyethylene, poly (vinyl chloride), polystyrene, poly (methyl methacrylate), 
nylon, and the fluorocarbons. 




546 • Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures

(d) network (three-dimensional) molecular structures. Circles designate individual 
repeat units. 


Branched Polymers 

Polymers may be synthesized in which side-branch chains are connected to the 
main ones, as indicated schematically in Figure 14.75; these are fittingly called 
branched polymer branched polymers. The branches, considered to be part of the main-chain mole¬ 
cule, may result from side reactions that occur during the synthesis of the polymer. 
The chain packing efficiency is reduced with the formation of side branches, which 
results in a lowering of the polymer density. Polymers that form linear structures 
may also be branched. For example, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is prima¬ 
rily a linear polymer, whereas low-density polyethylene (LDPE) contains short 
chain branches. 

Crosslinked Polymers 

crosslinked polymer In crosslinked polymers, adjacent linear chains are joined one to another at various 
positions by covalent bonds, as represented in Figure 14.7c. The process of crosslink¬ 
ing is achieved either during synthesis or by a nonreversible chemical reaction. Often, 
this crosslinking is accomplished by additive atoms or molecules that are covalently 
bonded to the chains. Many of the rubber elastic materials are crosslinked; in rubbers, 
this is called vulcanization, a process described in Section 15.9. 


14.8 Molecular Configurations * 547 


Network Polymers 

Multifunctional monomers forming three or more active covalent bonds make 
network polymer three-dimensional networks (Figure 14.7 d) and are termed network polymers. 

Actually, a polymer that is highly crosslinked may also be classified as a network 
polymer. These materials have distinctive mechanical and thermal properties; the 
epoxies, polyurethanes, and phenol-formaldehyde belong to this group. 

Polymers are not usually of only one distinctive structural type. For example, a 
predominantly linear polymer may have limited branching and crosslinking. 


14.8 MOLECULAR CONFIGURATIONS 

For polymers having more than one side atom or group of atoms bonded to the 
main chain, the regularity and symmetry of the side group arrangement can signif¬ 
icantly influence the properties. Consider the repeat unit 

H H 


— c —c — 
H (i 


in which R represents an atom or side group other than hydrogen (e.g., Cl, CH 3 ). 
One arrangement is possible when the R side groups of successive repeat units are 
bound to alternate carbon atoms as follows: 

H H H H 

i i i i 
—c—c—c—c— 

H (R) H (R) 

This is designated as a head-to-tail configuration. 7 Its complement, the head-to-head 
configuration, occurs when R groups are bound to adjacent chain atoms: 

H H H H 

I I I I 
—c—c—c—c— 



In most polymers, the head-to-tail configuration predominates; often a polar re¬ 
pulsion occurs between R groups for the head-to-head configuration. 

Isomerism (Section 14.2) is also found in polymer molecules, wherein different 
atomic configurations are possible for the same composition. Two isomeric sub¬ 
classes, stereoisomerism and geometrical isomerism, are topics of discussion in the 
succeeding sections. 


7 The term configuration is used in reference to arrangements of units along the axis of the 
chain, or atom positions that are not alterable except by the breaking and then re-forming 
of primary bonds.

Stereoisomerism denotes the situation in which atoms are linked together in the

This is called an isotactic configuration. This diagram shows the zigzag pattern of 
the carbon chain atoms. Furthermore, representation of the structural geometry in 
three dimensions is important, as indicated by the wedge-shaped bonds; solid wedges 
represent bonds that project out of the plane of the page, and dashed ones repre¬ 
sent bonds that project into the page . 8

Conversion from one stereoisomer to another (e.g., isotactic to syndiotactic) is 
not possible by a simple rotation about single chain bonds; these bonds must first 
be severed, and then, after the appropriate rotation, they are re-formed. 

In reality, a specific polymer does not exhibit just one of these configurations; 
the predominant form depends on the method of synthesis. 

Geometrical Isomerism 

Other important chain configurations, or geometrical isomers, are possible within 
repeat units having a double bond between chain carbon atoms. Bonded to each of 
the carbon atoms participating in the double bond is a side group, which may be 
situated on one side of the chain or its opposite. Consider the isoprene repeat unit 
having the structure 


C = C 

/ \ 

-ch 2 ch 2 - 

in which the CH 3 group and the H atom are positioned on the same side of the dou¬ 
ble bond. This is termed a cis structure, and the resulting polymer, ds-polyisoprene, 
is natural rubber. For the alternative isomer 



C = C 

-ch 2 ^ 


the trans structure, the CH 3 and H reside on opposite sides of the double bond . 11 
Tnms-polyisoprene, sometimes called gutta percha, has properties that are distinctly 
different from natural rubber as a result of this configurational alteration. Conver¬ 
sion of trans to cis, or vice versa, is not possible by a simple chain bond rotation be¬ 
cause the chain double bond is extremely rigid. 

Summarizing the preceding sections, polymer molecules may be characterized 
in terms of their size, shape, and structure. Molecular size is specified in terms of 
molecular weight (or degree of polymerization). Molecular shape relates to the de¬ 
gree of chain twisting, coiling, and bending. Molecular structure depends on the 
manner in which structural units are joined together. Linear, branched, crosslinked,

structural elements are not mutually exclusive, and it may be necessary to specify 
molecular structure in terms of more than one. For example, a linear polymer may

14.9 THERMOPLASTIC AND THERMOSETTING 
POLYMERS 


thermoplastic polymer 

thermosetting 

polymer 


The response of a polymer to mechanical forces at elevated temperatures is re¬ 
lated to its dominant molecular structure. In fact, one classification scheme for 
these materials is according to behavior with rising temperature. Thermoplastics 
(or thermoplastic polymers) and thermosets (or thermosetting polymers) are the 
two subdivisions. Thermoplastics soften when heated (and eventually liquefy) and 
harden when cooled—processes that are totally reversible and may be repeated. 
On a molecular level, as the temperature is raised, secondary bonding forces are 
diminished (by increased molecular motion) so that the relative movement of 





























14.10 Copolymers * 551 


adjacent chains is facilitated when a stress is applied. Irreversible degradation re¬ 
sults when a molten thermoplastic polymer is raised to too high a temperature. In 
addition, thermoplastics are relatively soft. Most linear polymers and those having 
some branched structures with flexible chains are thermoplastic. These materials 
are normally fabricated by the simultaneous application of heat and pressure (see 
Section 15.22). Examples of common thermoplastic polymers include polyethylene, 
polystyrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(vinyl chloride). 

Thermosetting polymers are network polymers. They become permanently hard 
during their formation and do not soften upon heating. Network polymers have co¬ 
valent crosslinks between adjacent molecular chains. During heat treatments, these 
bonds anchor the chains together to resist the vibrational and rotational chain mo¬ 
tions at high temperatures. Thus, the materials do not soften when heated. Crosslink¬ 
ing is usually extensive, in that 10 to 50% of the chain repeat units are crosslinked. 
Only heating to excessive temperatures will cause severance of these crosslink bonds 
and polymer degradation. Thermoset polymers are generally harder and stronger 
than thermoplastics and have better dimensional stability. Most of the crosslinked 
and network polymers, which include vulcanized rubbers, epoxies, and phenolics 
and some polyester resins, are thermosetting.

graft copolymer 


Polymer chemists and scientists are continually searching for new materials that can 
be easily and economically synthesized and fabricated, with improved properties or 
better property combinations than are offered by the homopolymers previously dis¬ 
cussed. One group of these materials are the copolymers. 

Consider a copolymer that is composed of two repeat units as represented by 
• and • in Figure 14.9. Depending on the polymerization process and the relative 
fractions of these repeat unit types, different sequencing arrangements along the 
polymer chains are possible. For one, as depicted in Figure 14.9a, the two different 
units are randomly dispersed along the chain in what is termed a random copolymer. 
For an alternating copolymer, as the name suggests, the two repeat units alternate 
chain positions, as illustrated in Figure 14.9 b. A block copolymer is one in which 
identical repeat units are clustered in blocks along the chain (Figure 14.9c). Finally, 
homopolymer side branches of one type may be grafted to homopolymer main 
chains that are composed of a different repeat unit; such a material is termed a graft 
copolymer (Figure 14.9 d). 

When calculating the degree of polymerization for a copolymer, the value m in 
Equation 14.7 is replaced with the average value m that is determined from

Synthetic rubbers, discussed in Section 15.16, are often copolymers; chemical 
repeat units that are employed in some of these rubbers are shown in Table 14.5. 
Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) is a common random copolymer from which au¬ 
tomobile tires are made. Nitrile rubber (NBR) is another random copolymer com¬ 
posed of acrylonitrile and butadiene. It is also highly elastic and, in addition, resistant 
to swelling in organic solvents; gasoline hoses are made of NBR. Impact-modified 
polystyrene is a block copolymer that consists of alternating blocks of styrene and 
butadiene. The rubbery isoprene blocks act to slow cracks propagating through 
the material. 

14.11 POLYMER CRYSTALLINITY 

The crystalline state may exist in polymeric materials. However, because it involves 
molecules instead of just atoms or ions, as with metals and ceramics, the atomic 

polymer crystallinity arrangements will be more complex for polymers. We think of polymer crystallinity 
as the packing of molecular chains to produce an ordered atomic array. Crystal struc¬ 
tures may be specified in terms of unit cells, which are often quite complex. For ex¬ 
ample, Figure 14.10 shows the unit cell for polyethylene and its relationship to the 
molecular chain structure; this unit cell has orthorhombic geometry (Table 3.2). Of 
course, the chain molecules also extend beyond the unit cell shown in the figure.

Percent crystallinity 
(semicrystalline 
polymer- 
dependence on 
specimen density, 
and densities of 
totally crystalline 
and totally 
amorphous 
materials 


/ Polymer Structures 

Molecular substances having small molecules (e.g., water and methane) are nor¬ 
mally either totally crystalline (as solids) or totally amorphous (as liquids). As a 
consequence of their size and often complexity, polymer molecules are often only 
partially crystalline (or semicrystalline), having crystalline regions dispersed within 
the remaining amorphous material. Any chain disorder or misalignment will result 
in an amorphous region, a condition that is fairly common, because twisting, kink¬ 
ing, and coiling of the chains prevent the strict ordering of every segment of every 
chain. Other structural effects are also influential in determining the extent of crys¬ 
tallinity, as discussed shortly. 

The degree of crystallinity may range from completely amorphous to almost 
entirely (up to about 95%) crystalline; in contrast, metal specimens are almost 
always entirely crystalline, whereas many ceramics are either totally crystalline or 
totally noncrystalline. Semicrystalline polymers are, in a sense, analogous to two- 
phase metal alloys, discussed previously. 

The density of a crystalline polymer will be greater than an amorphous one of 
the same material and molecular weight, because the chains are more closely packed 
together for the crystalline structure. The degree of crystallinity by weight may be 
determined from accurate density measurements, according to 


Pcips ~ Pa) 

% crystallinity = X 100 

Ps \Pc Pa ) 


(14.8) 


where p s is the density of a specimen for which the percent crystallinity is to be de¬ 
termined, p a is the density of the totally amorphous polymer, and p c is the density 
of the perfectly crystalline polymer. The values of p a and p c must be measured by 
other experimental means. 

The degree of crystallinity of a polymer depends on the rate of cooling dur¬ 
ing solidification as well as on the chain configuration. During crystallization 
upon cooling through the melting temperature, the chains, which are highly ran¬ 
dom and entangled in the viscous liquid, must assume an ordered configuration. 
For this to occur, sufficient time must be allowed for the chains to move and 
align themselves. 

The molecular chemistry as well as chain configuration also influence the 
ability of a polymer to crystallize. Crystallization is not favored in polymers that 
are composed of chemically complex repeat units (e.g., polyisoprene). On the 
other hand, crystallization is not easily prevented in chemically simple polymers 
such as polyethylene and polytetrafluoroethylene, even for very rapid cooling 
rates. 

For linear polymers, crystallization is easily accomplished because there are 
few restrictions to prevent chain alignment. Any side branches interfere with crys¬ 
tallization, such that branched polymers never are highly crystalline; in fact, 
excessive branching may prevent any crystallization whatsoever. Most network 
and crosslinked polymers are almost totally amorphous because the crosslinks 
prevent the polymer chains from rearranging and aligning into a crystalline struc¬ 
ture. A few crosslinked polymers are partially crystalline. With regard to the 
stereoisomers, atactic polymers are difficult to crystallize; however, isotactic and 
syndiotactic polymers crystallize much more easily because the regularity of the 
geometry of the side groups facilitates the process of fitting together adjacent 
chains. Also, the bulkier or larger the side-bonded groups of atoms, the less 
tendency for crystallization. 



14.11 Polymer Crystallinity • 555 


For copolymers, as a general rule, the more irregular and random the repeat 
unit arrangements, the greater the tendency for the development of noncrys¬ 
tallinity. For alternating and block copolymers there is some likelihood of 
crystallization. On the other hand, random and graft copolymers are normally 
amorphous. 

To some extent, the physical properties of polymeric materials are influenced 
by the degree of crystallinity. Crystalline polymers are usually stronger and more 
resistant to dissolution and softening by heat. Some of these properties are dis¬ 
cussed in subsequent chapters.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 14.2 

Computations of the Density and Percent Crystallinity of 
Polyethylene 

(a) Compute the density of totally crystalline polyethylene. The orthorhom¬ 
bic unit cell for polyethylene is shown in Figure 14.10; also, the equivalent of 
two ethylene repeat units is contained within each unit cell. 

(b) Using the answer to part (a), calculate the percent crystallinity of a 
branched polyethylene that has a density of 0.925 g/cm 3 . The density for the 
totally amorphous material is 0.870 g/cm 3 . 

Solution 

(a) Equation 3.5, used in Chapter 3 to determine densities for metals, also ap¬ 
plies to polymeric materials and is used to solve this problem. It takes the 
same form— 


nA 

P = CK 

where n represents the number of repeat units within the unit cell (for 
polyethylene n = 2), and A is the repeat unit molecular weight, which for 
polyethylene is 

A = 2(A c ) + 4 (A H ) 

= (2)(12.01 g/mol) + (4)(1.008 g/mol) = 28.05 g/mol 

Also, V c is the unit cell volume, which is just the product of the three unit cell 
edge lengths in Figure 14.10; or 

V c = (0.741 nm)(0.494 nm) (0.255 nm) 

= (7.41 X 10“ 8 cm)(4.94 X 10“ 8 cm)(2.55 X 10“ 8 cm) 

= 9.33 X 10- 23 cm 3 /unit cell

Now, substitution into Equation 3.5 of this value, values for n and A cited 
previously, and the value of N A , leads to

(b) We now use Equation 14.8 to calculate the percent crystallinity of 
the branched polyethylene with p c = 0.998 g/cm 3 , p a = 0.870 g/cm 3 , and 
p s = 0.925 g/cm 3 . Thus,

14.12 POLYMER CRYSTALS 

It has been proposed that a semicrystalline polymer consists of small crystalline 
crystallite regions (crystallites), each having a precise alignment, which are interspersed with 

amorphous regions composed of randomly oriented molecules. The structure of 
the crystalline regions may be deduced by examination of polymer single crystals, 
which may be grown from dilute solutions. These crystals are regularly shaped, thin 
platelets (or lamellae), approximately 10 to 20 nm thick, and on the order of 10 
ixm long. Frequently, these platelets will form a multilayered structure, like that 
shown in the electron micrograph of a single crystal of polyethylene in Figure 14.11. 
The molecular chains within each platelet fold back and forth on themselves, with 
chain-folded model folds occurring at the faces; this structure, aptly termed the chain-folded model, is

illustrated schematically in Figure 14.12. Each platelet will consist of a number of 
molecules; however, the average chain length will be much greater than the thick¬ 
ness of the platelet. 

Many bulk polymers that are crystallized from a melt are semicrystalline and 
form a spherulite structure. As implied by the name, each spherulite may grow to 
be roughly spherical in shape; one of them, as found in natural rubber, is shown in 
the transmission electron micrograph in the ( d ) chapter-opening photograph for 
this chapter. The spherulite consists of an aggregate of ribbonlike chain-folded crys¬ 
tallites (lamellae) approximately 10 nm thick that radiate outward from a single 
nucleation site in the center. In this electron micrograph, these lamellae appear as 
thin white lines. The detailed structure of a spherulite is illustrated schematically in 
Figure 14.13. Shown here are the individual chain-folded lamellar crystals that are

separated by amorphous material. Tie-chain molecules that act as connecting links 
between adjacent lamellae pass through these amorphous regions. 

As the crystallization of a spherulitic structure nears completion, the extremi¬ 
ties of adjacent spherulites begin to impinge on one another, forming more or less 
planar boundaries; prior to this time, they maintain their spherical shape. These 
boundaries are evident in Figure 14.14, which is a photomicrograph of polyethyl¬ 
ene using cross-polarized light. A characteristic Maltese cross pattern appears within 
each spherulite. The bands or rings in the spherulite image result from twisting of 
the lamellar crystals as they extend like ribbons from the center. 

Spherulites are considered to be the polymer analogue of grains in polycrys- 
talline metals and ceramics. However, as discussed earlier, each spherulite is really 
composed of many different lamellar crystals and, in addition, some amorphous ma¬ 
terial. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly (vinyl chloride), polytetrafluoroethylene, 
and nylon form a spherulitic structure when they crystallize from a melt. 

14.13 DEFECTS IN POLYMERS 

The point defect concept is different in polymers than in metals (Section 4.2) and 
ceramics (Section 12.5) as a consequence of the chainlike macromolecules and the 
nature of the crystalline state for polymers. Point defects similar to those found in 
metals have been observed in crystalline regions of polymeric materials; these in¬ 
clude vacancies and interstitial atoms and ions. Chain ends are considered defects 
because they are chemically dissimilar to normal chain units. Vacancies are also as¬ 
sociated with the chain ends (Figure 14.15). However, additional defects can result 
from branches in the polymer chain or chain segments that emerge from the crys¬ 
tal. A chain section can leave a polymer crystal and reenter it at another point, cre¬ 
ating a loop, or can enter a second crystal to act as a tie molecule (see Figure 14.13). 
Screw dislocations also occur in polymer crystals (Figure 14.15). Impurity atoms/ions 
or groups of atoms/ions may be incorporated in the molecular structure as inter¬ 
stitials; they may also be associated with main chains or as short side branches. 

Furthermore, the surfaces of chain-folded layers (Figure 14.13) are considered 
interfacial defects, as are also boundaries between two adjacent crystalline regions.

14.14 DIFFUSION IN POLYMERIC MATERIALS 

For polymeric materials, our interest is often in the diffusive motion of small for¬ 
eign molecules (e.g., 0 2 , H 2 0, C0 2 , CH 4 ) between the molecular chains, rather than 
in the diffusive motion of chain atoms within the polymer structure. A polymer’s 
permeability and absorption characteristics relate to the degree to which foreign 
substances diffuse into the material. Penetration of these foreign substances can 
lead to swelling and/or chemical reactions with the polymer molecules, and often a 
degradation of the material’s mechanical and physical properties (Section 17.11). 

Rates of diffusion are greater through amorphous regions than through crys¬ 
talline regions; the structure of amorphous material is more “open.” This diffusion 
mechanism may be considered analogous to interstitial diffusion in metals—that is, 
in polymers, diffusive movements occur through small voids between polymer chains 
from one open amorphous region to an adjacent open one. 

Foreign molecule size also affects the diffusion rate: smaller molecules diffuse 
faster than larger ones. Furthermore, diffusion is more rapid for foreign molecules 
that are chemically inert than for those that interact with the polymer. 

One step in diffusion through a polymer membrane is the dissolution of the mo¬ 
lecular species in the membrane material. This dissolution is a time-dependent process, 
and, if slower than the diffusive motion, may limit the overall rate of diffusion. Con¬ 
sequently, the diffusion properties of polymers are often characterized in terms of a 
permeability coefficient (denoted by Pm), where for the case of steady-state diffusion 
through a polymer membrane, Fick’s first law (Equation 5.3), is modified as 

A P 

J = P„- (14.9) 

In this expression, / is the diffusion flux of gas through the membrane [(cm 3 
STP)/(cm 2 . s)] , P M is the permeability coefficient, Ax is the membrane thickness, and 
A P is the difference in pressure of the gas across the membrane. For small mole¬ 
cules in nonglassy polymers the permeability coefficient can be approximated as

Table 14.6 presents the permeability coefficients of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, 
and water vapor in several common polymers. 12 

For some applications, low permeability rates through polymeric materials are 
desirable, as with food and beverage packaging and automobile tires and inner tubes. 
Polymer membranes are often used as filters, to selectively separate one chemical 
species from another (or others) (i.e., the desalination of water). In such instances 
it is normally the case that the permeation rate of the substance to be filtered is 
significantly greater than for the other substance(s). 

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 14.3 

Computations of Diffusion Flux of Carbon Dioxide through 
a Plastic Beverage Container and Beverage Shelf Life 

The clear plastic bottles used for carbonated beverages (sometimes also called 
“soda,” “pop,” or “soda pop”) are made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
(PET). The “fizz” in pop results from dissolved carbon dioxide (C0 2 ); because 


12 The units for permeability coefficients in Table 14.6 are unusual, which are explained as 
follows: When the diffusing molecular species is in the gas phase, solubility is equal to 



where C is the concentration of the diffusing species in the polymer [in units of (cm 3 
STP)/cm 3 gas] and P is the partial pressure (in units of Pa). STP indicates that this is the 
volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure [273 K (0°C) and 101.3 kPa (1 atm)]. 
Thus, the units for S are (cm 3 STP)/Pa-cm 3 . Because D is expressed in terms of cm 2 /s, the 
units for the permeability coefficient are (cm 3 STP)(cm)/(cm 2 -s-Pa). 









Summary * * 561 


PET is permeable to C0 2 , pop stored in PET bottles will eventually go “flat” 
(i.e., lose its fizz). A 20-oz. bottle of pop has a C0 2 pressure of about 400 kPa 
inside the bottle, and the C0 2 pressure outside the bottle is 0.4 kPa. 

(a) Assuming conditions of steady state, calculate the diffusion flux of C0 2 
through the wall of the bottle. 

(b) If the bottle must lose 750 (cm 3 STP) of C0 2 before the pop tastes flat, 
what is the shelf life for a bottle of pop? 

Note : assume that each bottle has a surface area of 500 cm 2 and a wall thick¬ 
ness of 0.05 cm. 


Solution 

(a) This is a permeability problem in which Equation 14.9 is employed. The 
permeability coefficient of C0 2 through PET (Table 14.6) is 0.23 X 1CT 13 (cm 3 
STP)(cm)/(cm 2 -s-Pa). Thus, the diffusion flux is equal to

(b) The flow rate of C0 2 through the wall of the bottle V COi is equal to

where A is the surface area of the bottle (i.e., 500 cm 2 ); therefore, 

V COi = [1.8 X 10 -7 (cm 3 STP)/(cm 2 • s)] (500 cm 2 ) = 9.0 X 10“ 5 (cm 3 STP)/s

SUMMARY 


Polymer Molecules 

• Most polymeric materials are composed of very large molecular chains with side 
groups of various atoms (O, Cl, etc.) or organic groups such as methyl, ethyl, or 
phenyl groups. 

• These macromolecules are composed of repeat units, smaller structural entities, 
which are repeated along the chain. 

The Chemistry of Polymer Molecules 

• Repeat units for some of the chemically simple polymers [polyethylene, polyte- 
trafluoroethylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polypropylene, etc.] are presented in 
Table 14.3. 

• A homopolymer is one for which all of the repeat units are the same type. The 
chains for copolymers are composed of two or more kinds of repeat units. 










562 * Chapter 14 / Polymer Structures 

• Repeat units are classified according to the number of active bonds (i.e., func¬ 
tionality): 

For bifunctional, a two-dimensional chainlike structure results from a monomer 
that has two active bonds. 

Trifunctional monomers have three active bonds, from which three-dimensional 
network structures form. 

Molecular Weight 

• Molecular weights for high polymers may be in excess of a million. Because all 
molecules are not of the same size, there is a distribution of molecular weights. 

• Molecular weight is often expressed in terms of number and weight averages; val¬ 
ues for these parameters may be determined using Equations 14.5a and 14.5b, 
respectively. 

• Chain length may also be specified by degree of polymerization, the number of 
repeat units per average molecule (Equation 14.6). 

Molecular Shape 

• Molecular entanglements occur when the chains assume twisted, coiled, and 
kinked shapes or contours as a consequence of chain bond rotations. 

• Rotational flexibility is diminished when double chain bonds are present, and 
also when bulky side groups are part of the repeat unit. 

Molecular Structure 

• Four different polymer molecular chain structures are possible: linear (Figure 
14.7a), branched (Figure 14.76), crosslinked (Figure 14.7c), and network (Figure 
14.7J). 

Molecular Configurations 

• For repeat units that have more than one side atom or groups of atoms bonded 
to the main chain: 

Head-to-head and head-to-tail configurations are possible. 

Differences in spatial arrangements of these side atoms or groups of atoms 
lead to isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic stereoisomers. 

• When a repeat unit contains a double chain bond, both cis and trans geometri¬ 
cal isomers are possible. 

Thermoplastic and Thermosetting Polymers 

• With regard to behavior at elevated temperatures, polymers are classified as ei¬ 
ther thermoplastic or thermosetting. 

Thermoplastic polymers have linear and branched structures; they soften 
when heated and harden when cooled. 

In contrast, thermosetting polymers, once they have hardened, will not soften 
upon heating; their structures are crosslinked and network. 

Copolymers 

• The copolymers include random (Figure 14.9a), alternating (Figure 14.96), block 
(Figure 14.9c), and graft (Figure 14.9d) types. 

• Repeat units that are employed in copolymer rubber materials are presented in 
Table 14.5. 


Summary * 563 


Polymer Crystallinity 

• When the molecular chains are aligned and packed in an ordered atomic arrange¬ 
ment, the condition of crystallinity is said to exist. 

• Amorphous polymers are also possible wherein the chains are misaligned and 
disordered. 

• In addition to being entirely amorphous, polymers may also exhibit varying 
degrees of crystallinity; that is, crystalline regions are interdispersed within 
amorphous areas. 

• Crystallinity is facilitated for polymers that are chemically simple and that have 
regular and symmetrical chain structures. 

• The percent crystallinity of a semicrystalline polymer is dependent on its density 
as well as the densities of the totally crystalline and totally amorphous materials 
according to Equation 14.8. 

Polymer Crystals 

• Crystalline regions (or crystallites) are plate-shaped and have a chain-folded 
structure (Figure 14.12)—chains within the platelet are aligned and fold back and 
forth on themselves, with folds occurring at the faces. 

• Many semicrystalline polymers form spherulites; each spherulite consists of a col¬ 
lection of ribbonlike chain-folded lamellar crystallites that radiate outward from 
its center. 

Defects in Polymers 

• Although the point defect concept in polymers is different than in metals and 
ceramics, vacancies, interstitial atoms, and impurity atoms/ions and groups of 
atoms/ions as interstitials have been found to exist in crystalline regions. 

• Other defects include chain ends, dangling and loose chains, and dislocations 
(Figure 14.15). 

Diffusion in Polymeric Materials 

• With regard to diffusion in polymers, small molecules of foreign substances dif¬ 
fuse between molecular chains by an interstitial-type mechanism from one void 
to an adjacent one. 

• Diffusion (or permeation) of gaseous species is often characterized in terms of 
the permeability coefficient, which is the product of the diffusion coefficient and 
solubility in the polymer (Equation 14.10). 

• Permeation flow rates are expressed using a modified form of Fick’s first law 
(Equation 14.9).

WHY STUDY the Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers? 


There are several reasons why an engineer should know 
something about the characteristics, applications, and 
processing of polymeric materials. Polymers are used in a 
wide variety of applications, such as construction materi¬ 
als and microelectronics processing. Thus, most engineers 
will be required to work with polymers at some point in 
their careers. Understanding the mechanisms by which 
polymers elastically and plastically deform allows one to 
alter and control their moduli of elasticity and strengths 
(Sections 15.7 and 15.8). Also, additives may be incor¬ 
porated into polymeric materials to modify a host of 
properties, including strength, abrasion resistance, 
toughness, thermal stability, stiffness, deteriorability, 
color, and flammability resistance (Section 15.21). 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme for polymer fibers, reasons for studying the 
characteristics, applications, and processing of polymers 
are as follows: 


• Polymeric materials that are used for fibers in tex¬ 
tiles (i.e., clothing) must be relatively strong. In this 
chapter we discuss the mechanical characteristics of 
polymers, the mechanisms (on a molecular scale) 
by which semicrystal line polymers plastically 
deform, and, finally, techniques that are available 
to strengthen these materials. 

• Several techniques are used to form polymer fibers; 
in one fabrication procedure the fibers are spun 
from the molten material. This chapter discusses 
the phenomenon of melting for polymers, the 
concept of melting temperature, and structural 
characteristics of polymers that influence melting 
temperature. The magnitude of a fiber's melting 
temperature will influence the manner in which it 
is processed as well as the maximum temperature at 
which it may be used. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Make schematic plots of the three characteristic 5. 
stress-strain behaviors observed for polymeric 
materials. 

2. Describe/sketch the various stages in the elastic 6. 
and plastic deformations of a semicrystalline 
(spherulitic) polymer. 

3. Discuss the influence of the following factors on 7. 
polymer tensile modulus and/or strength: 

(a) molecular weight, (b) degree of crystallinity, 8. 
(c) predeformation, and (d) heat treating of 
undeformed materials. 

4. Describe the molecular mechanism by which 9. 

elastomeric polymers deform elastically. 


List four characteristics or structural components 
of a polymer that affect both its melting and 
glass transition temperatures. 

Cite the seven different polymer application 
types and, for each, note its general 
characteristics. 

Briefly describe addition and condensation 
polymerization mechanisms. 

Name the five types of polymer additives 
and, for each, indicate how it modifies the 
properties. 

Name and briefly describe five fabrication 
techniques used for plastic polymers. 


15.1 INTRODUCTION 

This chapter discusses some of the characteristics important to polymeric materials 
and, the various types and processing techniques. 

Mechanical Behavior of Polymers 

15.2 STRESS-STRAIN BEHAVIOR 

The mechanical properties of polymers are specified with many of the same param¬ 
eters that are used for metals—that is, modulus of elasticity and yield and tensile 
strengths. For many polymeric materials, the simple stress-strain test is used to

Polymers 


characterize some of these mechanical parameters. 1 The mechanical characteristics 
of polymers, for the most part, are highly sensitive to the rate of deformation (strain 
rate), the temperature, and the chemical nature of the environment (the presence 
of water, oxygen, organic solvents, etc.). Some modifications of the testing tech¬ 
niques and specimen configurations used for metals (Chapter 6) are necessary with 
polymers, especially for the highly elastic materials, such as rubbers. 

Three typically different types of stress-strain behavior are found for polymeric 
materials, as represented in Figure 15.1. Curve A illustrates the stress-strain char¬ 
acter for a brittle polymer, inasmuch as it fractures while deforming elastically. The 
behavior for a plastic material, curve B , is similar to that for many metallic mate¬ 
rials; the initial deformation is elastic, which is followed by yielding and a region of 
plastic deformation. Finally, the deformation displayed by curve C is totally elastic; 
this rubberlike elasticity (large recoverable strains produced at low stress levels) is 
displayed by a class of polymers termed the elastomers. 

Modulus of elasticity (termed tensile modulus or sometimes just modulus for 
polymers) and ductility in percent elongation are determined for polymers in the 
same manner as for metals (Section 6.6). For plastic polymers (curve B , Figure 15.1), 
the yield point is taken as a maximum on the curve, which occurs just beyond the 
termination of the linear-elastic region (Figure 15.2). The stress at this maximum is

curve for a plastic polymer showing

the yield strength (cr^). Furthermore, tensile strength ( TS ) corresponds to the stress 
at which fracture occurs (Figure 15.2); TS may be greater than or less than cr y . 
Strength, for these plastic polymers, is normally taken as tensile strength. Table 15.1 
gives these mechanical properties for several polymeric materials; more compre¬ 
hensive lists are provided in Tables B.2, B.3, and B.4, Appendix B. 

Polymers are, in many respects, mechanically dissimilar to metals (Figures 1.4, 
1.5, and 1.6). For example, the modulus for highly elastic polymeric materials may 
be as low as 7 MPa (10 3 psi), but may run as high as 4 GPa (0.6 X 10 6 psi) for some 
of the very stiff polymers; modulus values for metals are much larger and range be¬ 
tween 48 and 410 GPa (7 X 10 6 to 60 X 10 6 psi). Maximum tensile strengths for 
polymers are about 100 MPa (15,000 psi)—for some metal alloys 4100 MPa (600,000 
psi). And, whereas metals rarely elongate plastically to more than 100%, some highly 
elastic polymers may experience elongations to greater than 1000%. 

In addition, the mechanical characteristics of polymers are much more sensi¬ 
tive to temperature changes near room temperature. Consider the stress—strain be¬ 
havior for poly(methyl methacrylate) (Plexiglas) at several temperatures between 
4 and 60°C (40 and 140°F) (Figure 15.3). Increasing the temperature produces (1) 
a decrease in elastic modulus, (2) a reduction in tensile strength, and (3) an en¬ 
hancement of ductility—at 4°C (40°F) the material is totally brittle, whereas there 
is considerable plastic deformation at both 50 and 60°C (122 and 140°F).

The influence of strain rate on the mechanical behavior may also be important. 
In general, decreasing the rate of deformation has the same influence on the 
stress-strain characteristics as increasing the temperature; that is, the material be¬ 
comes softer and more ductile.

Polymers 


Some aspects of the macroscopic deformation of semicrystalline polymers deserve 
our attention. The tensile stress-strain curve for a semicrystalline material, which was 
initially undeformed, is shown in Figure 15.4; also included in the figure are schematic 
representations of the specimen profiles at various stages of deformation. Both up¬ 
per and lower yield points are evident on the curve, which are followed by a near hor¬ 
izontal region. At the upper yield point, a small neck forms within the gauge section 
of the specimen. Within this neck, the chains become oriented (i.e., chain axes become 
aligned parallel to the elongation direction, a condition that is represented schemat¬ 
ically in Figure 15.13d), which leads to localized strengthening. Consequently, there is 
a resistance to continued deformation at this point, and specimen elongation proceeds 
by the propagation of this neck region along the gauge length; the chain orientation 
phenomenon (Figure 15.13d) accompanies this neck extension. This tensile behavior 
may be contrasted to that found for ductile metals (Section 6.6), wherein once a neck 
has formed, all subsequent deformation is confined to within the neck region.

not necessary to specify the specimen gauge length, as is the case with metals. Why 
is this so?

15.4 VISCOELASTIC DEFORMATION 

An amorphous polymer may behave like a glass at low temperatures, a rubbery 
solid at intermediate temperatures [above the glass transition temperature (Section 
15.12)], and a viscous liquid as the temperature is further raised. For relatively small 
deformations, the mechanical behavior at low temperatures may be elastic; that is, 
in conformity to Hooke’s law, a = Ee. At the highest temperatures, viscous or liquid¬ 
like behavior prevails. For intermediate temperatures the polymer is a rubbery solid 
that exhibits the combined mechanical characteristics of these two extremes; the 
viscoelasticity condition is termed viscoelasticity. 

Elastic deformation is instantaneous, which means that total deformation (or 
strain) occurs the instant the stress is applied or released (i.e., the strain is inde¬ 
pendent of time). In addition, upon release of the external stress, the deformation 
is totally recovered—the specimen assumes its original dimensions. This behavior is 
represented in Figure 15.5 b as strain versus time for the instantaneous load-time 
curve, shown in Figure 15.5a. 

By way of contrast, for totally viscous behavior, deformation or strain is not in¬ 
stantaneous; that is, in response to an applied stress, deformation is delayed or de¬ 
pendent on time. Also, this deformation is not reversible or completely recovered 
after the stress is released. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 15.5 d. 

For the intermediate viscoelastic behavior, the imposition of a stress in the man¬ 
ner of Figure 15.5a results in an instantaneous elastic strain, which is followed by a 
viscous, time-dependent strain, a form of anelasticity (Section 6.4); this behavior is 
illustrated in Figure 15.5c. 

A familiar example of these viscoelastic extremes is found in a silicone poly¬ 
mer that is sold as a novelty and known by some as “Silly Putty.” When rolled into

a ball and dropped onto a horizontal surface, it bounces elastically—the rate of de¬ 
formation during the bounce is very rapid. On the other hand, if pulled in tension 
with a gradually increasing applied stress, the material elongates or flows like a 
highly viscous liquid. For this and other viscoelastic materials, the rate of strain de¬ 
termines whether the deformation is elastic or viscous. 

Viscoelastic Relaxation Modulus 

The viscoelastic behavior of polymeric materials is dependent on both time and 
temperature; several experimental techniques may be used to measure and quan¬ 
tify this behavior. Stress relaxation measurements represent one possibility. With 
these tests, a specimen is initially strained rapidly in tension to a predetermined and 
relatively low strain level. The stress necessary to maintain this strain is measured 
as a function of time, while temperature is held constant. Stress is found to decrease 
with time because of molecular relaxation processes that take place within the poly¬ 
mer. We may define a relaxation modulus E r (t ), a time-dependent elastic modulus 
for viscoelastic polymers, as 


cr{t) 

E r (t) = — (15.1) 

6 0 

where cr(t) is the measured time-dependent stress and e 0 is the strain level, which 
is maintained constant. 

Furthermore, the magnitude of the relaxation modulus is a function of temper¬ 
ature; to more fully characterize the viscoelastic behavior of a polymer, isothermal 
stress relaxation measurements must be conducted over a range of temperatures. 
Figure 15.6 is a schematic log E r (t)-v ersus-log time plot for a polymer that exhibits

viscoelastic behavior. Curves generated at a variety of temperatures are included. 
Key features of this plot are that (1) the magnitude of Eft ) decreases with time 
(corresponding to the decay of stress, Equation 15.1), and (2) the curves are dis¬ 
placed to lower Eft) levels with increasing temperature. 

To represent the influence of temperature, data points are taken at a specific 
time from the log E r (^)-versus-log time plot—for example, t { in Figure 15.6—and 
then cross-plotted as log Eftf) versus temperature. Figure 15.7 is such a plot for an 
amorphous (atactic) polystyrene; in this case, t { was arbitrarily taken 10 s after the 
load application. Several distinct regions may be noted on the curve shown in this 
figure. At the lowest temperatures, in the glassy region, the material is rigid and 
brittle, and the value of Ef 10) is that of the elastic modulus, which initially is vir¬ 
tually independent of temperature. Over this temperature range, the strain-time 
characteristics are as represented in Figure 15.5 b. On a molecular level, the long 
molecular chains are essentially frozen in position at these temperatures. 

As the temperature is increased, EfVS) drops abruptly by about a factor of 10 3 
within a 20°C (35°F) temperature span; this is sometimes called the leathery, or glass 
transition region, and the glass transition temperature ( T g , Section 15.13) lies near 
the upper temperature extremity; for polystyrene (Figure 15.7), T g = 100°C (212°F). 
Within this temperature region, a polymer specimen will be leathery; that is, defor¬ 
mation will be time dependent and not totally recoverable on release of an applied 
load, characteristics that are depicted in Figure 15.5c. 

Within the rubbery plateau temperature region (Figure 15.7), the material de¬ 
forms in a rubbery manner; here, both elastic and viscous components are present, 
and deformation is easy to produce because the relaxation modulus is relatively low. 




















15.4 Viscoelastic Deformation * 577 


The final two high-temperature regions are rubbery flow and viscous flow. Upon 
heating through these temperatures, the material experiences a gradual transition 
to a soft rubbery state, and finally to a viscous liquid. In the rubbery flow region, 
the polymer is a very viscous liquid that exhibits both elastic and viscous flow com¬ 
ponents. Within the viscous flow region, the modulus decreases dramatically with 
increasing temperature; again, the strain-time behavior is as represented in Figure 
15.5<i. From a molecular standpoint, chain motion intensifies so greatly that for vis¬ 
cous flow, the chain segments experience vibration and rotational motion largely 
independent of one another. At these temperatures, any deformation is entirely vis¬ 
cous and essentially no elastic behavior occurs. 

Normally, the deformation behavior of a viscous polymer is specified in terms 
of viscosity, a measure of a material’s resistance to flow by shear forces. Viscosity 
is discussed for the inorganic glasses in Section 12.10. 

The rate of stress application also influences the viscoelastic characteristics. In¬ 
creasing the loading rate has the same influence as lowering temperature. 

The log £ r (10)-versus-temperature behavior for polystyrene materials having 
several molecular configurations is plotted in Figure 15.8. The curve for the amor¬ 
phous material (curve C) is the same as in Figure 15.7. For a lightly crosslinked at¬ 
actic polystyrene (curve B ), the rubbery region forms a plateau that extends to the 
temperature at which the polymer decomposes; this material will not experience 
melting. For increased crosslinking, the magnitude of the plateau E r (10) value will 
also increase. Rubber or elastomeric materials display this type of behavior and are 
ordinarily used at temperatures within this plateau range. 

Also shown in Figure 15.8 is the temperature dependence for an almost totally 
crystalline isotactic polystyrene (curve A). The decrease in E r (lO) at T g is much less 
pronounced than the other polystyrene materials because only a small volume 
fraction of this material is amorphous and experiences the glass transition. Further¬ 
more, the relaxation modulus is maintained at a relatively high value with increas¬ 
ing temperature until its melting temperature T m is approached. From Figure 15.8, 
the melting temperature of this isotactic polystyrene is about 240°C (460°F).

Viscoelastic Creep 

Many polymeric materials are susceptible to time-dependent deformation when the 
stress level is maintained constant; such deformation is termed viscoelastic creep. This 
type of deformation may be significant even at room temperature and under modest 
stresses that lie below the yield strength of the material. For example, automobile tires 
may develop flat spots on their contact surfaces when the automobile is parked for 
prolonged time periods. Creep tests on polymers are conducted in the same manner 
as for metals (Chapter 8); that is, a stress (normally tensile) is applied instantaneously 
and is maintained at a constant level while strain is measured as a function of time. 
Furthermore, the tests are performed under isothermal conditions. Creep results are 
represented as a time-dependent creep modulus E c (t ), defined by 2 

m = (15.2) 

wherein <x 0 is the constant applied stress and e{t) is the time-dependent strain. 
The creep modulus is also temperature sensitive and diminishes with increasing 
temperature. 

With regard to the influence of molecular structure on the creep characteris¬ 
tics, as a general rule the susceptibility to creep decreases [i.e., E c (t ) increases] as 
the degree of crystallinity increases.

15.5 FRACTURE OF POLYMERS 

The fracture strengths of polymeric materials are low relative to those of metals 
and ceramics. As a general rule, the mode of fracture in thermosetting polymers 
(heavily crosslinked networks) is brittle. In simple terms, during the fracture process, 
cracks form at regions where there is a localized stress concentration (i.e., scratches, 
notches, and sharp flaws). As with metals (Section 8.5), the stress is amplified at the 
tips of these cracks, leading to crack propagation and fracture. Covalent bonds in 
the network or crosslinked structure are severed during fracture. 

For thermoplastic polymers, both ductile and brittle modes are possible, and many 
of these materials are capable of experiencing a ductile-to-brittle transition. Factors 
that favor brittle fracture are a reduction in temperature, an increase in strain rate, the 
presence of a sharp notch, increased specimen thickness, and any modification of the 
polymer structure that raises the glass transition temperature (7^) (see Section 15.14). 
Glassy thermoplastics are brittle below their glass transition temperatures. However, 
as the temperature is raised, they become ductile in the vicinity of their 7^s and expe¬ 
rience plastic yielding prior to fracture. This behavior is demonstrated by the 
stress-strain characteristics of poly(methyl methacrylate) in Figure 15.3. At 4°C, 
PMMA is totally brittle, whereas at 60°C it becomes extremely ductile. 


2 Creep compliance , J c (t ), the reciprocal of the creep modulus, is also sometimes used in this 
context.

Sussex, England, 1982.) 


One phenomenon that frequently precedes fracture in some thermoplastic poly¬ 
mers is crazing. Associated with crazes are regions of very localized plastic deforma¬ 
tion, which lead to the formation of small and interconnected microvoids (Figure 15.9a). 
Fibrillar bridges form between these microvoids wherein molecular chains become 
oriented as in Figure 15.13<i. If the applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges 
elongate and break, causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce. As the microvoids 
coalesce, cracks begin to form, as demonstrated in Figure 15.9 b. A craze is different 
from a crack in that it can support a load across its face. Furthermore, this process of 
craze growth prior to cracking absorbs fracture energy and effectively increases the 
fracture toughness of the polymer. In glassy polymers, the cracks propagate with little 
craze formation, resulting in low fracture toughnesses. Crazes form at highly stressed 
regions associated with scratches, flaws, and molecular inhomogeneities; in addition, 
they propagate perpendicular to the applied tensile stress and typically are 5 |xm or 
less thick. Figure 15.10 is a photomicrograph in which a craze is shown.

Principles of fracture mechanics developed in Section 8.5 also apply to brittle 
and quasi-brittle polymers; the susceptibility of these materials to fracture when a 
crack is present may be expressed in terms of the plane strain fracture toughness. 
The magnitude of K Ic will depend on characteristics of the polymer (molecular 
weight, percent crystallinity, etc.) as well as temperature, strain rate, and the exter¬ 
nal environment. Representative values of K lc for several polymers are included in 
Table 8.1 and Table B.5, Appendix B. 

15.6 MISCELLANEOUS MECHANICAL 
CHARACTERISTICS 

Impact Strength 

The degree of resistance of a polymeric material to impact loading may be of con¬ 
cern in some applications. Izod or Charpy tests are ordinarily used to assess impact 
strength (Section 8.6). As with metals, polymers may exhibit ductile or brittle frac¬ 
ture under impact loading conditions, depending on the temperature, specimen size, 
strain rate, and mode of loading, as discussed in the preceding section. Both semi¬ 
crystalline and amorphous polymers are brittle at low temperatures, and both have 
relatively low impact strengths. However, they experience a ductile-to-brittle tran¬ 
sition over a relatively narrow temperature range, similar to that shown for a steel 
in Figure 8.13. Of course, impact strength undergoes a gradual decrease at still higher 
temperatures as the polymer begins to soften. Ordinarily, the two impact charac¬ 
teristics most sought after are a high impact strength at the ambient temperature 
and a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature that lies below room temperature. 

Fatigue 

Polymers may experience fatigue failure under conditions of cyclic loading. As with 
metals, fatigue occurs at stress levels that are low relative to the yield strength. 
Fatigue testing in polymers has not been nearly as extensive as with metals; however, 
fatigue data are plotted in the same manner for both types of material, and the 
resulting curves have the same general shape. Fatigue curves for several common 
polymers are shown in Figure 15.11, as stress versus the number of cycles to failure

(on a logarithmic scale). Some polymers have a fatigue limit (a stress level at which 
the stress at failure becomes independent of the number of cycles); others do not 
appear to have such a limit. As would be expected, fatigue strengths and fatigue 
limits for polymeric materials are much lower than for metals. 

The fatigue behavior of polymers is much more sensitive to loading frequency 
than for metals. Cycling polymers at high frequencies and/or relatively large stresses 
can cause localized heating; consequently, failure may be due to a softening of the 
material rather than a result of typical fatigue processes. 

Tear Strength and Hardness 

Other mechanical properties that are sometimes influential in the suitability of a 
polymer for some particular application include tear resistance and hardness. The 
ability to resist tearing is an important property of some plastics, especially those 
used for thin films in packaging. Tear strength , the mechanical parameter that is 
measured, is the energy required to tear apart a cut specimen that has a standard 
geometry. The magnitude of tensile and tear strengths are related. 

As with metals, hardness represents a material’s resistance to scratching, pen¬ 
etration, marring, and so on. Polymers are softer than metals and ceramics, and most 
hardness tests are conducted by penetration techniques similar to those described 
for metals in Section 6.10. Rockwell tests are frequently used for polymers. 3 Other 
indentation techniques employed are the Durometer and Bar col. 4 

Mechanisms of Deformation and 
for Strengthening of Polymers 

An understanding of deformation mechanisms of polymers is important in order 
for us to be able to manage the mechanical characteristics of these materials. In this 
regard, deformation models for two different types of polymers—semicrystalline 
and elastomeric—deserve our attention. The stiffness and strength of semicrystalline 
materials are often important considerations; elastic and plastic deformation mech¬ 
anisms are treated in the succeeding section, whereas methods used to stiffen and 
strengthen these materials are discussed in Section 15.8. On the other hand, elas¬ 
tomers are used on the basis of their unusual elastic properties; the deformation 
mechanism of elastomers is also treated. 

15.7 DEFORMATION OF SEMICRYSTALLINE 
POLYMERS 

Many semicrystalline polymers in bulk form have the spherulitic structure described 
in Section 14.12. By way of review, each spherulite consists of numerous chain- 
folded ribbons, or lamellae, that radiate outward from the center. Separating these 
lamellae are areas of amorphous material (Figure 14.13); adjacent lamellae are con¬ 
nected by tie chains that pass through these amorphous regions.

582 * Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 

Mechanism of Elastic Deformation 

As with other material types, elastic deformation of polymers occurs at relatively 
low stress levels on the stress-strain curve (Figure 15.1). The onset of elastic defor¬ 
mation for semicrystalline polymers results from chain molecules in amorphous 
regions elongating in the direction of the applied tensile stress. This process is rep¬ 
resented schematically for two adjacent chain-folded lamellae and the interlamel- 
lar amorphous material as Stage 1 in Figure 15.12. Continued deformation in the 
second stage occurs by changes in both amorphous and lamellar crystalline regions. 
Amorphous chains continue to align and become elongated; in addition, there is 
bending and stretching of the strong chain covalent bonds within the lamellar 
crystallites. This leads to a slight, reversible increase in the lamellar crystallite thick¬ 
ness as indicated by A t in Figure 15.12c. 

Inasmuch as semicrystalline polymers are composed of both crystalline and 
amorphous regions, they may, in a sense, be considered composite materials. There¬ 
fore, the elastic modulus may be taken as some combination of the moduli of crys¬ 
talline and amorphous phases. 

Mechanism of Plastic Deformation 

The transition from elastic to plastic deformation occurs in Stage 3 of Figure 15.13. 
(Note that Figure 15.12c is identical to Figure 15.13a.) During Stage 3, adjacent 
chains in the lamellae slide past one another (Figure 15.13 b); this results in tilting 
of the lamellae so that the chain folds become more aligned with the tensile axis. 
Any chain displacement is resisted by relatively weak secondary or van der Waals 
bonds. 

Crystalline block segments separate from the lamellae, in Stage 4 (Figure 
15.13c), with the segments attached to one another by tie chains. In the final stage, 
Stage 5, the blocks and tie chains become oriented in the direction of the tensile 
axis (Figure 15.13d). Thus, appreciable tensile deformation of semicrystalline poly¬ 
mers produces a highly oriented structure. This process of orientation is referred to 
drawing as drawing, and is commonly used to improve the mechanical properties of poly¬ 

mer fibers and films (this is discussed in more detail in Section 15.24). 

During deformation the spherulites experience shape changes for moderate 
levels of elongation. However, for large deformations, the spherulitic structure is 
virtually destroyed. Also, to a degree, the processes represented in Figure 15.13 are 
reversible. That is, if deformation is terminated at some arbitrary stage, and the 
specimen is heated to an elevated temperature near its melting point (i.e., is 
annealed), the material will recrystallize to again form a spherulitic structure. Fur¬ 
thermore, the specimen will tend to shrink back, in part, to the dimensions it had 
prior to deformation. The extent of this shape and structural recovery will depend 
on the annealing temperature and also the degree of elongation. 


15.8 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE 
MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
SEMICRYSTALLINE POLYMERS 

A number of factors influence the mechanical characteristics of polymeric materi¬ 
als. For example, we have already discussed the effects of temperature and strain 
rate on stress-strain behavior (Section 15.2, Figure 15.3). Again, increasing the tem¬ 
perature or diminishing the strain rate leads to a decrease in the tensile modulus, 
a reduction in tensile strength, and an enhancement of ductility.

15.8 Factors That Influence the Mechanical Properties of Semicrystalline Polymers * 585 


In addition, several structural/processing factors have decided influences on the 
mechanical behavior (i.e., strength and modulus) of polymeric materials. An increase 
in strength results whenever any restraint is imposed on the process illustrated in 
Figure 15.13; for example, extensive chain entanglements or a significant degree of 
intermolecular bonding inhibit relative chain motions. Even though secondary inter- 
molecular (e.g., van der Waals) bonds are much weaker than the primary covalent ones, 
significant intermolecular forces result from the formation of large numbers of van 
der Waals interchain bonds. Furthermore, the modulus rises as both the secondary 
bond strength and chain alignment increase. As a result, polymers with polar groups 
will have stronger secondary bonds and a larger elastic modulus. We now discuss how 
several structural/processing factors [molecular weight, degree of crystallinity, prede¬ 
formation (drawing), and heat-treating] affect the mechanical behavior of polymers. 


For some polymers, 
dependence of 
tensile strength on 
number-average 
molecular weight 


Molecular Weight 

The magnitude of the tensile modulus does not seem to be directly influenced by 
molecular weight. On the other hand, for many polymers it has been observed that 
tensile strength increases with increasing molecular weight. Mathematically, TS is a 
function of the number-average molecular weight according to 

TS = TS X - (15.3) 

M n 

where TS X is the tensile strength at infinite molecular weight and A is a constant. 
The behavior described by this equation is explained by increased chain entangle¬ 
ments with rising M n . 


Degree of Crystallinity 

For a specific polymer, the degree of crystallinity can have a significant influence on 
the mechanical properties, because it affects the extent of the intermolecular second¬ 
ary bonding. For crystalline regions in which molecular chains are closely packed in 
an ordered and parallel arrangement, extensive secondary bonding ordinarily exists 
between adjacent chain segments. This secondary bonding is much less prevalent in 
amorphous regions, by virtue of the chain misalignment. As a consequence, for semi¬ 
crystalline polymers, tensile modulus increases significantly with degree of crystallinity. 
For example, for polyethylene, the modulus increases approximately an order of 
magnitude as the crystallinity fraction is raised from 0.3 to 0.6. 

Furthermore, increasing the crystallinity of a polymer generally enhances its 
strength; in addition, the material tends to become more brittle. The influence of 
chain chemistry and structure (branching, stereoisomerism, etc.) on degree of crys¬ 
tallinity was discussed in Chapter 14. 

The effects of both percent crystallinity and molecular weight on the physical 
state of polyethylene are represented in Figure 15.14. 

Predeformation by Drawing 

On a commercial basis, one of the most important techniques used to improve me¬ 
chanical strength and tensile modulus is to permanently deform the polymer in 
tension. This procedure is sometimes termed drawing and corresponds to the neck 
extension process illustrated schematically in Figure 15.4. In terms of property 
alterations, drawing is the polymer analogue of strain hardening in metals. It is an

/ Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 



important stiffening and strengthening technique that is employed in the production 
of fibers and films. During drawing the molecular chains slip past one another and 
become highly oriented; for semicrystalline materials the chains assume conforma¬ 
tions similar to that represented schematically in Figure 15.13d. 

Degrees of strengthening and stiffening will depend on the extent of deforma¬ 
tion (or extension) of the material. Furthermore, the properties of drawn polymers 
are highly anisotropic. For materials drawn in uniaxial tension, tensile modulus and 
strength values are significantly greater in the direction of deformation than in other 
directions. Tensile modulus in the direction of drawing may be enhanced by up to 
approximately a factor of three relative to the undrawn material. At an angle of 45° 
from the tensile axis the modulus is a minimum; at this orientation the modulus has 
a value on the order of one-fifth that of the undrawn polymer. 

Tensile strength parallel to the direction of orientation may be improved by a 
factor of at least two to five relative to that of the unoriented material. On the other 
hand, perpendicular to the alignment direction, tensile strength is reduced by on 
the order of one-third to one-half. 

For an amorphous polymer that is drawn at an elevated temperature, the ori¬ 
ented molecular structure is retained only when the material is quickly cooled to 
the ambient; this procedure gives rise to the strengthening and stiffening effects 
described in the previous paragraph. On the other hand, if, after stretching, the poly¬ 
mer is held at the temperature of drawing, molecular chains relax and assume 
random conformations characteristic of the predeformed state; as a consequence, 
drawing will have no effect on the mechanical characteristics of the material. 

Heat-Treating 

Heat-treating (or annealing) of semicrystalline polymers can lead to an increase in 
the percent crystallinity, and crystallite size and perfection, as well as modifications 
of the spherulite structure. For undrawn materials that are subjected to constant-time 
heat treatments, increasing the annealing temperature leads to the following: (1) an 
increase in tensile modulus, (2) an increase in yield strength, and (3) a reduction in 
ductility. Note that these annealing effects are opposite to those typically observed 
for metallic materials (Section 7.12)—weakening, softening, and enhanced ductility. 

For some polymer fibers that have been drawn, the influence of annealing on 
the tensile modulus is contrary to that for undrawn materials—that is, modulus de¬ 
creases with increased annealing temperature because of a loss of chain orientation 
and strain-induced crystallinity.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Shrink-Wrap Polymer Films 


A n interesting application of heat treatment in 
polymers is the shrink-wrap used in packag¬ 
ing. Shrink-wrap is a polymer film, usually made 
of poly (vinyl chloride), polyethylene, or polyolefin 
(a multilayer sheet with alternating layers of poly¬ 
ethylene and polypropylene). It is initially plasti¬ 
cally deformed (cold drawn) by about 20-300% to 
provide a prestretched (aligned) film. The film is 
wrapped around an object to be packaged and 
sealed at the edges. When heated to about 100 to 
150°C, this prestretched material shrinks to re¬ 
cover 80-90% of its initial deformation, which 
gives a tightly stretched, wrinkle-free, transparent 
polymer film. For example, CDs and many other 
objects that you purchase are packaged in shrink¬ 
wrap.

15.9 DEFORMATION OF ELASTOMERS 

One of the fascinating properties of the elastomeric materials is their rubberlike 
elasticity. That is, they have the ability to be deformed to quite large deformations 
and then elastically spring back to their original form. This results from crosslinks 
in the polymer that provide a force to restore the chains to their undeformed con¬ 
formations. Elastomeric behavior was probably first observed in natural rubber; 
however, the past few years have brought about the synthesis of a large number of 
elastomers with a wide variety of properties. Typical stress-strain characteristics of 
elastomeric materials are displayed in Figure 15.1, curve C. Their moduli of elastic¬ 
ity are quite small and, furthermore, vary with strain because the stress-strain curve 
is nonlinear. 

In an unstressed state, an elastomer will be amorphous and composed of 
crosslinked molecular chains that are highly twisted, kinked, and coiled. Elastic de¬ 
formation, upon application of a tensile load, is simply the partial uncoiling, un¬ 
twisting, and straightening, and the resultant elongation of the chains in the stress 
direction, a phenomenon represented in Figure 15.15. Upon release of the stress, 
the chains spring back to their prestressed conformations, and the macroscopic piece 
returns to its original shape. 

Part of the driving force for elastic deformation is a thermodynamic parame¬ 
ter called entropy, which is a measure of the degree of disorder within a system; en¬ 
tropy increases with increasing disorder. As an elastomer is stretched and the chains 
straighten and become more aligned, the system becomes more ordered. From this 
state, the entropy increases if the chains return to their original kinked and coiled 
contours. Two intriguing phenomena result from this entropic effect. First, when 
stretched, an elastomer experiences a rise in temperature; second, the modulus of 
elasticity increases with increasing temperature, which is opposite to the behavior 
found in other materials (see Figure 6.8). 

Several criteria must be met for a polymer to be elastomeric: (1) It must not eas¬ 
ily crystallize; elastomeric materials are amorphous, having molecular chains that are 
naturally coiled and kinked in the unstressed state. (2) Chain bond rotations must be 
relatively free for the coiled chains to readily respond to an applied force. (3) For 
elastomers to experience relatively large elastic deformations, the onset of plastic de¬ 
formation must be delayed. Restricting the motions of chains past one another by 
crosslinking accomplishes this objective. The crosslinks act as anchor points between 
the chains and prevent chain slippage from occurring; the role of crosslinks in the de¬ 
formation process is illustrated in Figure 15.15. Crosslinking in many elastomers is 
carried out in a process called vulcanization, to be discussed shortly. (4) Finally, the 
elastomer must be above its glass transition temperature (Section 15.13). The lowest

temperature at which rubberlike behavior persists for many of the common elas¬ 
tomers is between -50 and -90°C (-60 and — 130°F). Below its glass transition tem¬ 
perature, an elastomer becomes brittle such that its stress-strain behavior resembles 
curve A in Figure 15.1. 

Vulcanization 

The crosslinking process in elastomers is called vulcanization, which is achieved by 
a nonreversible chemical reaction, ordinarily carried out at an elevated tempera¬ 
ture. In most vulcanizing reactions, sulfur compounds are added to the heated elas¬ 
tomer; chains of sulfur atoms bond with adjacent polymer backbone chains and 
crosslink them, which is accomplished according to the following reaction:

in which the two crosslinks shown consist of m and n sulfur atoms. Crosslink main 
chain sites are carbon atoms that were doubly bonded before vulcanization but, af¬ 
ter vulcanization, have become singly bonded. 

Unvulcanized rubber, which contains very few crosslinks, is soft and tacky and 
has poor resistance to abrasion. Modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, and resist¬ 
ance to degradation by oxidation are all enhanced by vulcanization. The magnitude 
of the modulus of elasticity is directly proportional to the density of the crosslinks. 
Stress-strain curves for vulcanized and unvulcanized natural rubber are presented 
in Figure 15.16. To produce a rubber that is capable of large extensions without rup¬ 
ture of the primary chain bonds, there must be relatively few crosslinks, and these

must be widely separated. Useful rubbers result when about 1 to 5 parts (by weight) 
of sulfur are added to 100 parts of rubber. This corresponds to about one crosslink 
for every 10 to 20 repeat units. Increasing the sulfur content further hardens the 
rubber and also reduces its extensibility. Also, because they are crosslinked, elas¬ 
tomeric materials are thermosetting in nature.

Crystallization, Melting, and Glass- 
Transition Phenomena in Polymers 

Three phenomena that are important with respect to the design and processing of 
polymeric materials are crystallization, melting, and the glass transition. Crystalliza¬ 
tion is the process by which, upon cooling, an ordered (i.e., crystalline) solid phase 
is produced from a liquid melt having a highly random molecular structure. The 
melting transformation is the reverse process that occurs when a polymer is heated. 
The glass-transition phenomenon occurs with amorphous or noncrystallizable poly¬ 
mers that, when cooled from a liquid melt, become rigid solids yet retain the 
disordered molecular structure that is characteristic of the liquid state. Of course, 
alterations of physical and mechanical properties attend crystallization, melting, and 
the glass transition. Furthermore, for semicrystalline polymers, crystalline regions 
will experience melting (and crystallization), whereas noncrystalline areas pass 
through the glass transition. 

15.10 CRYSTALLIZATION 

An understanding of the mechanism and kinetics of polymer crystallization is 
important because the degree of crystallinity influences the mechanical and thermal 
properties of these materials. The crystallization of a molten polymer occurs by

nucleation and growth processes, topics discussed in the context of phase transforma¬ 
tions for metals in Section 10.3. For polymers, upon cooling through the melting tem¬ 
perature, nuclei form wherein small regions of the tangled and random molecules 
become ordered and aligned in the manner of chain-folded layers (Figure 14.12). At 
temperatures in excess of the melting temperature, these nuclei are unstable because 
of the thermal atomic vibrations that tend to disrupt the ordered molecular arrange¬ 
ments. Subsequent to nucleation and during the crystallization growth stage, nuclei 
grow by the continued ordering and alignment of additional molecular chain seg¬ 
ments; that is, the chain-folded layers remain the same thickness, but increase in lat¬ 
eral dimensions, or for spherulitic structures (Figure 14.13) there is an increase in 
spherulite radius. 

The time dependence of crystallization is the same as for many solid-state trans¬ 
formations (Figure 10.10); that is, a sigmoidal-shaped curve results when fraction 
transformation (i.e., fraction crystallized) is plotted versus the logarithm of time (at 
constant temperature). Such a plot is presented in Figure 15.17 for the crystalliza¬ 
tion of polypropylene at three temperatures. Mathematically, fraction crystallized y 
is a function of time t according to the Avrami equation, Equation 10.17, as 

y = 1 - exp (~kt n ) (10.17) 

where k and n are time-independent constants, whose values depend on the 
crystallizing system. Normally, the extent of crystallization is measured by specimen 
volume changes because there will be a difference in volume for liquid and crys¬ 
tallized phases. Rate of crystallization may be specified in the same manner as for 
the transformations discussed in Section 10.3, and according to Equation 10.18; that 
is, rate is equal to the reciprocal of time required for crystallization to proceed to 
50% completion. This rate is dependent on crystallization temperature (Figure 
15.17) and also on the molecular weight of the polymer; rate decreases with increas¬ 
ing molecular weight. 

For polypropylene (as well as any polymer), the attainment of 100% crystallinity 
is not possible. Therefore, in Figure 15.17, the vertical axis is scaled as “normalized 
fraction crystallized.” A value of 1.0 for this parameter corresponds to the highest 
level of crystallization that is achieved during the tests, which, in reality, is less than 
complete crystallization.

15.11 MELTING 

The melting of a polymer crystal corresponds to the transformation of a solid 
material, having an ordered structure of aligned molecular chains, to a viscous 
liquid in which the structure is highly random. This phenomenon occurs, upon 
melting temperature heating, at the melting temperature, T m . There are several features distinctive to the 
melting of polymers that are not normally observed with metals and ceramics; 
these are consequences of the polymer molecular structures and lamellar crys¬ 
talline morphology. First of all, melting of polymers takes place over a range of 
temperatures; this phenomenon is discussed in more detail shortly. In addition, 
the melting behavior depends on the history of the specimen, in particular the 
temperature at which it crystallized. The thickness of chain-folded lamellae will 
depend on crystallization temperature; the thicker the lamellae, the higher the 
melting temperature. Impurities in the polymer and imperfections in the crystals 
also decrease the melting temperature. Finally, the apparent melting behavior is 
a function of the rate of heating; increasing this rate results in an elevation of the 
melting temperature. 

As a previous section notes, polymeric materials are responsive to heat treat¬ 
ments that produce structural and property alterations. An increase in lamellar 
thickness may be induced by annealing just below the melting temperature. An¬ 
nealing also raises the melting temperature by decreasing the vacancies and other 
imperfections in polymer crystals and increasing crystallite thickness. 


15.12 THE GLASS TRANSITION 

The glass transition occurs in amorphous (or glassy) and semicrystalline polymers 
and is due to a reduction in motion of large segments of molecular chains with de¬ 
creasing temperature. Upon cooling, the glass transition corresponds to the grad¬ 
ual transformation from a liquid to a rubbery material and finally to a rigid solid. 
The temperature at which the polymer experiences the transition from rubbery to 
glass transition rigid states is termed the glass transition temperature, T g . Of course, this sequence of 

temperature events occurs in the reverse order when a rigid glass at a temperature below T g is 

heated. In addition, abrupt changes in other physical properties accompany this 
glass transition: for example, stiffness (Figure 15.7), heat capacity, and coefficient of 
thermal expansion. 


15.13 MELTING AND GLASS TRANSITION 
TEMPERATURES 

Melting and glass transition temperatures are important parameters relative to in- 
service applications of polymers. They define, respectively, the upper and lower tem¬ 
perature limits for numerous applications, especially for semicrystalline polymers. 
The glass transition temperature may also define the upper use temperature for 
glassy amorphous materials. Furthermore, T m and T g also influence the fabrication 
and processing procedures for polymers and polymer-matrix composites. These is¬ 
sues are discussed in succeeding sections of this chapter. 

The temperatures at which melting and/or the glass transition occur for a poly¬ 
mer are determined in the same manner as for ceramic materials—from a plot of 
specific volume (the reciprocal of density) versus temperature. Figure 15.18 is such 
a plot, where curves A and C, for amorphous and crystalline polymers, respectively,

have the same configurations as their ceramic counterparts (Figure 13.6). 5 For the 
crystalline material, there is a discontinuous change in specific volume at the melt¬ 
ing temperature T m . The curve for the totally amorphous material is continuous 
but experiences a slight decrease in slope at the glass transition temperature, T g . 
The behavior is intermediate between these extremes for a semicrystalline poly¬ 
mer (curve B ) in that both melting and glass transition phenomena are observed; 
T m and T g are properties of the respective crystalline and amorphous phases in this 
semicrystalline material. As discussed earlier, the behaviors represented in 
Figure 15.18 will depend on the rate of cooling or heating. Representative melting 
and glass transition temperatures of a number of polymers are contained in 
Table 15.2 and Appendix E.

15.14 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MELTING AND 
GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURES 

Melting Temperature 

During melting of a polymer there will be a rearrangement of the molecules in the 
transformation from ordered to disordered molecular states. Molecular chemistry 
and structure will influence the ability of the polymer chain molecules to make these 
rearrangements and, therefore, will also affect the melting temperature. 

Chain stiffness, which is controlled by the ease of rotation about the chemical 
bonds along the chain, has a pronounced effect. The presence of double bonds and 
aromatic groups in the polymer backbone lowers chain flexibility and causes an 
increase in T m . Furthermore, the size and type of side groups influence chain rotational 
freedom and flexibility; bulky or large side groups tend to restrict molecular rotation 
and raise T m . For example, polypropylene has a higher melting temperature than poly¬ 
ethylene (175°C versus 115°C, Table 15.2); the CH 3 methyl side group for polypropy¬ 
lene is larger than the H atom found on polyethylene. The presence of polar groups 
(Cl, OH, and CN), even though not excessively large, leads to significant intermolec- 
ular bonding forces and relatively high T m s. This may be verified by comparing the 
melting temperatures of polypropylene (175°C) and poly(vinyl chloride) (212°C). 

The melting temperature of a polymer will also depend on molecular weight. 
At relatively low molecular weights, increasing M (or chain length) raises T m (Fig¬ 
ure 15.19). Furthermore, the melting of a polymer takes place over a range of 
temperatures; thus, there will be a range of T m s, rather than a single melting tem¬ 
perature. This is because every polymer will be composed of molecules having a 
variety of molecular weights (Section 14.5), and because T m depends on molecular 
weight. For most polymers, this melting temperature range will normally be on the 
order of several degrees Celsius. The melting temperatures cited in Table 15.2 and 
Appendix E are near the high ends of these ranges. 

Degree of branching will also affect the melting temperature of a polymer. The 
introduction of side branches introduces defects into the crystalline material and 
lowers the melting temperature. High-density polyethylene, being a predominately 
linear polymer, has a higher melting temperature (137°C, Table 15.2) than low- 
density polyethylene (115°C), which has some branching. 

Glass Transition Temperature 

Upon heating through the glass transition temperature, the amorphous solid polymer 
transforms from a rigid to a rubbery state. Correspondingly, the molecules that are

virtually frozen in position below T g begin to experience rotational and translational 
motions above T g . Thus, the value of the glass transition temperature will depend on 
molecular characteristics that affect chain stiffness; most of these factors and their in¬ 
fluences are the same as for the melting temperature, as discussed earlier. Again, chain 
flexibility is diminished and T g is increased by the presence of the following: 

1. Bulky side groups; from Table 15.2, the respective T g values for polypropylene 
and polystyrene are -18°C and 100°C. 

2. Polar groups; for example, the T g values for poly(vinyl chloride) and 
polypropylene are 87°C and — 18°C, respectively. 

3. Double bonds and aromatic groups in the backbone, which tend to stiffen 
the polymer chain. 

Increasing the molecular weight also tends to raise the glass transition temper¬ 
ature, as noted in Figure 15.19. A small amount of branching tends to lower T g ; on 
the other hand, a high density of branches reduces chain mobility and elevates the 
glass transition temperature. Some amorphous polymers are crosslinked, which has 
been observed to elevate T g \ crosslinks restrict molecular motion. With a high den¬ 
sity of crosslinks, molecular motion is virtually disallowed; long-range molecular 
motion is prevented, to the degree that these polymers do not experience a glass 
transition or its accompanying softening. 


From the preceding discussion it is evident that essentially the same molecular 
characteristics raise and lower both melting and glass transition temperatures. Nor¬ 
mally the value of T g lies somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8T m (in Kelvin). Conse¬ 
quently, for a homopolymer, it is not possible to independently vary both T m and 
T g . A greater degree of control over these two parameters is possible by the syn¬ 
thesis and utilization of copolymeric materials.

Polymer Types 

There are many different polymeric materials that are familiar to us and find a wide 
variety of applications; in fact, one way of classifying them is according to their end 
use. Within this scheme the various polymer types include plastics, elastomers (or 
rubbers), fibers, coatings, adhesives, foams, and films. Depending on its properties, 
a particular polymer may be used in two or more of these application categories. 
For example, a plastic, if crosslinked and utilized above its glass transition temper¬ 
ature, may make a satisfactory elastomer. Or a fiber material may be used as a 
plastic if it is not drawn into filaments. This portion of the chapter includes a brief 
discussion of each of these types of polymer. 


15.15 PLASTICS 

Possibly the largest number of different polymeric materials come under the plastic 
plastic classification. Plastics are materials that have some structural rigidity under load and 

are used in general-purpose applications. Polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl 
chloride), polystyrene, and the fluorocarbons, epoxies, phenolics, and polyesters may 
all be classified as plastics. They have a wide variety of combinations of properties. 
Some plastics are very rigid and brittle (Figure 15.1, curve A). Others are flexible, ex¬ 
hibiting both elastic and plastic deformations when stressed and sometimes experi¬ 
encing considerable deformation before fracture (Figure 15.1, curve B ). 

Polymers falling within this classification may have any degree of crystallinity, 
and all molecular structures and configurations (linear, branched, isotactic, etc.) are 
possible. Plastic materials may be either thermoplastic or thermosetting; in fact, this 
is the manner in which they are usually subclassified. However, to be considered 
plastics, linear or branched polymers must be used below their glass transition tem¬ 
peratures (if amorphous) or below their melting temperatures (if semicrystalline), 
or must be crosslinked enough to maintain their shape. The trade names, charac¬ 
teristics, and typical applications for a number of plastics are given in Table 15.3. 

Several plastics exhibit especially outstanding properties. For applications in which 
optical transparency is critical, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) are espe¬ 
cially well suited; however, it is imperative that the material be highly amorphous or, 
if semicrystalline, have very small crystallites. The fluorocarbons have a low coefficient 
of friction and are extremely resistant to attack by a host of chemicals, even at rela¬ 
tively high temperatures. They are used as coatings on nonstick cookware, in bearings 
and bushings, and for high-temperature electronic components.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Phenolic Billiard Balls 


U p until about 1912, virtually all billiard balls 
were made of ivory that came only from the 
tusks of elephants. For a ball to roll true, it needed 
to be fashioned from high-quality ivory that came 
from the center of flaw-free tusks—on the order 
of 1 tusk in 50 had the requisite consistency of den¬ 
sity. At this time, ivory was becoming scarce and 
expensive as more and more elephants were be¬ 
ing killed (and billiards was becoming popular). 
Also, there was then (and still is) a serious con¬ 
cern about reductions in elephant populations 
(and their ultimate extinction) due to ivory 
hunters, and some countries had imposed (and still 


impose) severe restrictions on the importation of 
ivory and ivory products. 

Consequently, substitutes for ivory were 
sought for billiard balls. For example, one early al¬ 
ternative was a pressed mixture of wood pulp and 
bone dust; this material proved quite unsatisfac¬ 
tory. The most suitable replacement (which is still 
being used for billiard balls today) is one of the 
first synthetic polymers—phenol-formaldehyde, 
sometimes also called phenolic. 

The invention of this material is one of the impor¬ 
tant and interesting events in the annals of synthetic 
polymers. The discoverer of the process for synthesiz- 









15.16 Elastomers * 599 


ing phenol-formaldehyde was Leo Baekeland. As 
a young and very bright Ph.D. chemist, he immi¬ 
grated from Belgium to the United States in the 
early 1900s. Shortly after his arrival, he began 
research into creating a synthetic shellac to replace 
the natural material, which was relatively expensive 
to manufacture; shellac was (and is still) used as a 
lacquer, a wood preservative, and an electrical insu¬ 
lator in the then-emerging electrical industry. His 
efforts eventually led to the discovery that a suit¬ 
able substitute could be synthesized by reacting phe¬ 
nol [or carbolic acid (C 6 H 5 OH), a white crystalline 
material] with formaldehyde (HCHO, a colorless 
and poisonous gas) under controlled conditions of 
heat and pressure. The product of this reaction was 
a liquid that subsequently hardened into a trans¬ 
parent and amber-colored solid. Baekeland named 
his new material Bakelite; today we use the generic 


names phenol-formaldehyde or just phenolic. 
Shortly after its discovery, Bakelite was found to be 
the ideal synthetic material for billiard balls (per the 
chapter-opening photographs for this chapter). 

Phenol-formaldehyde is a thermosetting poly¬ 
mer and has a number of desirable properties; for 
a polymer it is very heat resistant and hard, is less 
brittle than many of the ceramic materials, is very 
stable and unreactive with most common solutions 
and solvents, and doesn’t easily chip, fade, or dis¬ 
color. Furthermore, it is a relatively inexpensive 
material, and modern phenolics can be produced 
having a large variety of colors. The elastic char¬ 
acteristics of this polymer are very similar to those 
of ivory, and when phenolic billiard balls collide, 
they make the same clicking sound as ivory balls. 
Other uses of this important polymeric material 
are found in Table 15.3. 


15.16 ELASTOMERS 

The characteristics of and deformation mechanism for elastomers were treated pre¬ 
viously (Section 15.9). The present discussion, therefore, focuses on the types of 
elastomeric materials. 

Table 15.4 lists properties and applications of common elastomers; these prop¬ 
erties are typical and, of course, depend on the degree of vulcanization and on 
whether any reinforcement is used. Natural rubber is still used to a large degree 
because it has an outstanding combination of desirable properties. However, the 
most important synthetic elastomer is SBR, which is used predominantly in auto¬ 
mobile tires, reinforced with carbon black. NBR, which is highly resistant to degra¬ 
dation and swelling, is another common synthetic elastomer. 

For many applications (e.g., automobile tires), the mechanical properties of even 
vulcanized rubbers are not satisfactory in terms of tensile strength, abrasion and 
tear resistance, and stiffness. These characteristics may be further improved by ad¬ 
ditives such as carbon black (Section 16.2). 

Finally, some mention should be made of the silicone rubbers. For these mate¬ 
rials, the backbone chain is made of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms: 

R 

i 

-f Si OV 
R' 

where R and R' represent side-bonded atoms such as hydrogen or groups of atoms 
such as CH 3 . For example, polydimethylsiloxane has the repeat unit 

CH 3 

-f Si — OV 

ch 3 

Of course, as elastomers, these materials are crosslinked.

The silicone elastomers possess a high degree of flexibility at low tempera¬ 
tures [to -90°C (-130°F)] and yet are stable to temperatures as high as 250°C 
(480°F). In addition, they are resistant to weathering and lubricating oils, which 
makes them particularly desirable for applications in automobile engine com¬ 
partments. Biocompatibility is another of their assets, and, therefore, they are of¬ 
ten employed in medical applications such as blood tubing. A further attractive 
characteristic is that some silicone rubbers vulcanize at room temperature (RTV 
rubbers).

15.17 FIBERS 

fiber The fiber polymers are capable of being drawn into long filaments having at least 

a 100:1 length-to-diameter ratio. Most commercial fiber polymers are used in the 
textile industry, being woven or knit into cloth or fabric. In addition, the aramid 
fibers are employed in composite materials (Section 16.8). To be useful as a textile 
material, a fiber polymer must have a host of rather restrictive physical and chem¬ 
ical properties. While in use, fibers may be subjected to a variety of mechanical de¬ 
formations—stretching, twisting, shearing, and abrasion. Consequently, they must 
have a high tensile strength (over a relatively wide temperature range) and a high 
modulus of elasticity, as well as abrasion resistance. These properties are governed 
by the chemistry of the polymer chains and also by the fiber-drawing process. 

The molecular weight of fiber materials should be relatively high or the molten 
material will be too weak and will break during the drawing process. Also, because 
the tensile strength increases with degree of crystallinity, the structure and config¬ 
uration of the chains should allow the production of a highly crystalline polymer. 
That translates into a requirement for linear and unbranched chains that are sym¬ 
metrical and have regular repeat units. Polar groups in the polymer also improve 
the fiber-forming properties by increasing both crystallinity and the intermolecular 
forces between the chains. 

Convenience in washing and maintaining clothing depends primarily on the ther¬ 
mal properties of the fiber polymer, that is, its melting and glass transition tempera¬ 
tures. Furthermore, fiber polymers must exhibit chemical stability to a rather exten¬ 
sive variety of environments, including acids, bases, bleaches, dry-cleaning solvents, and 
sunlight. In addition, they must be relatively nonflammable and amenable to drying. 

15.18 MISCELLANEOUS APPLICATIONS 

Coatings 

Coatings are frequently applied to the surface of materials to serve one or more of 
the following functions: (1) to protect the item from the environment that may pro¬ 
duce corrosive or deteriorative reactions; (2) to improve the item’s appearance; and 
(3) to provide electrical insulation. Many of the ingredients in coating materials are 








602 * Chapter 15 


adhesive 


/ Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 

polymers, most of which are organic in origin. These organic coatings fall into sev¬ 
eral different classifications: paint, varnish, enamel, lacquer, and shellac. 

Many common coatings are latexes. A latex is a stable suspension of small in¬ 
soluble polymer particles dispersed in water. These materials have become increas¬ 
ingly popular because they don’t contain large quantities of organic solvents that 
are emitted into the environment—that is, they have low volatile organic compound 
(VOC) emissions. VOCs react in the atmosphere to produce smog. Large users of 
coatings such as automobile manufacturers continue to reduce their VOC emissions 
to comply with environmental regulations. 

Adhesives 

An adhesive is a substance used to bond together the surfaces of two solid materi¬ 
als (termed adherends). There are two types of bonding mechanisms: mechanical 
and chemical. In mechanical bonding there is actual penetration of the adhesive 
into surface pores and crevices. Chemical bonding involves intermolecular forces 
between the adhesive and adherend, which forces may be covalent and/or van der 
Waals; the degree of van der Waals bonding is enhanced when the adhesive mate¬ 
rial contains polar groups. 

Although natural adhesives (animal glue, casein, starch, and rosin) are still used 
for many applications, a host of new adhesive materials based on synthetic poly¬ 
mers have been developed; these include polyurethanes, polysiloxanes (silicones), 
epoxies, polyimides, acrylics, and rubber materials. Adhesives may be used to join 
a large variety of materials—metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, skin, and so 
on—and the choice of which adhesive to use will depend on such factors as (1) the 
materials to be bonded and their porosities; (2) the required adhesive properties 
(i.e., whether the bond is to be temporary or permanent); (3) maximum/minimum 
exposure temperatures; and (4) processing conditions. 

For all but the pressure-sensitive adhesives (discussed shortly), the adhesive 
material is applied as a low-viscosity liquid, so as to cover the adherend surfaces 
evenly and completely and allow for maximum bonding interactions. The actual 
bonding joint forms as the adhesive undergoes a liquid-to-solid transition (or cures), 
which may be accomplished through either a physical process (e.g., crystallization, 
solvent evaporation) or a chemical process [e.g., polymerization (Section 15.20), vul¬ 
canization]. Characteristics of a sound joint should include high shear, peel, and 
fracture strengths. 

Adhesive bonding offers some advantages over other joining technologies (e.g., 
riveting, bolting, and welding), including lighter weight, the ability to join dissimi¬ 
lar materials and thin components, better fatigue resistance, and lower manufactur¬ 
ing costs. Furthermore, it is the technology of choice when exact positioning of 
components and processing speed are essential. The chief drawback of adhesive 
joints is service temperature limitation; polymers maintain their mechanical integrity 
only at relatively low temperatures, and strength decreases rapidly with increasing 
temperature. The maximum temperature possible for continuous use for some of 
the newly developed polymers is 300°C. Adhesive joints are found in a large num¬ 
ber of applications, especially in the aerospace, automotive, and construction indus¬ 
tries, in packaging, and some household goods. 

A special class of this group of materials is the pressure-sensitive adhesives (or 
self-adhesive materials), such as those found on self-stick tapes, labels, and postage 
stamps. These materials are designed to adhere to just about any surface by mak¬ 
ing contact and with the application of slight pressure. Unlike the adhesives de¬ 
scribed previously, bonding action does not result from a physical transformation 


15.19 Advanced Polymeric Materials * 603 


or a chemical reaction. Rather, these materials contain polymer tackifying resins; 
during detachment of the two bonding surfaces, small fibrils form that are attached 
to the surfaces and tend to hold them together. Polymers used for pressure-sensi¬ 
tive adhesives include the acrylics, styrenic block copolymers (Section 15.19), and 
natural rubber. 

Films 

Polymeric materials have found widespread use in the form of thin films. Films hav¬ 
ing thicknesses between 0.025 and 0.125 mm (0.001 and 0.005 in.) are fabricated 
and used extensively as bags for packaging food products and other merchandise, 
as textile products, and in a host of other uses. Important characteristics of the ma¬ 
terials produced and used as films include low density, a high degree of flexibility, 
high tensile and tear strengths, resistance to attack by moisture and other chemi¬ 
cals, and low permeability to some gases, especially water vapor (Section 14.14). 
Some of the polymers that meet these criteria and are manufactured in film form 
are polyethylene, polypropylene, cellophane, and cellulose acetate. 

Foams 

foam Foams are plastic materials that contain a relatively high volume percentage of small 

pores and trapped gas bubbles. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting materials are 
used as foams; these include polyurethane, rubber, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chlo¬ 
ride). Foams are commonly used as cushions in automobiles and furniture as well 
as in packaging and thermal insulation. The foaming process is often carried out by 
incorporating into the batch of material a blowing agent that, upon heating, decom¬ 
poses with the liberation of a gas. Gas bubbles are generated throughout the now- 
fluid mass, which remain in the solid upon cooling and give rise to a spongelike 
structure. The same effect is produced by dissolving an inert gas into a molten poly¬ 
mer under high pressure. When the pressure is rapidly reduced, the gas comes out 
of solution and forms bubbles and pores that remain in the solid as it cools. 

15.19 ADVANCED POLYMERIC MATERIALS 

A number of new polymers having unique and desirable combinations of proper¬ 
ties have been developed over the past several years; many have found niches in 
new technologies and/or have satisfactorily replaced other materials. Some of these 
include ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, liquid crystal polymers, and ther¬ 
moplastic elastomers. Each of these will now be discussed. 

Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene 

ultra-high-molecular- Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) is a linear polyethylene that has 

weight polyethylene an extremely high molecular weight. Its typical M w is approximately 4 X 10 6 g/mol, 
which is an order of magnitude greater than that of high-density polyethylene. In 
fiber form, UHMWPE is highly aligned and has the trade name Spectra. Some of 
the extraordinary characteristics of this material are as follows: 

1. An extremely high impact resistance 

2. Outstanding resistance to wear and abrasion 

3. A very low coefficient of friction 

4. A self-lubricating and nonstick surface 

5. Very good chemical resistance to normally encountered solvents

6. Excellent low-temperature properties 

7. Outstanding sound damping and energy absorption characteristics 

8. Electrically insulating and excellent dielectric properties 

However, because this material has a relatively low melting temperature, its 
mechanical properties diminish rapidly with increasing temperature. 

This unusual combination of properties leads to numerous and diverse appli¬ 
cations for this material, including bulletproof vests, composite military helmets, 
fishing line, ski-bottom surfaces, golf ball cores, bowling alley and ice skating rink 
surfaces, biomedical prostheses, blood filters, marking pen nibs, bulk material han¬ 
dling equipment (for coal, grain, cement, gravel, etc.), bushings, pump impellers, and 
valve gaskets. 

Liquid Crystal Polymers 

The liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) are a group of chemically complex and structurally 
distinct materials that have unique properties and are used in diverse applications. 
Discussion of the chemistry of these materials is beyond the scope of this book. 
Suffice it to say that LCPs are composed of extended, rod-shaped, and rigid mole¬ 
cules. In terms of molecular arrangement, these materials do not fall within any of 
conventional liquid, amorphous, crystalline, or semicrystalline classifications, but 
may be considered a new state of matter—the liquid crystalline state, being neither 
crystalline nor liquid. In the melt (or liquid) condition, whereas other polymer mol¬ 
ecules are randomly oriented, LCP molecules can become aligned in highly ordered 
configurations. As solids, this molecular alignment remains, and, in addition, the mol¬ 
ecules form in domain structures having characteristic intermolecular spacings. A 
schematic comparison of liquid crystals, amorphous polymers, and semicrystalline poly¬ 
mers in both melt and solid states is illustrated in Figure 15.20. Furthermore, there are 
three types of liquid crystals, based on orientation and positional ordering—smectic,

nematic, and cholesteric; distinctions among these types are also beyond the scope 
of this discussion. 

The principal use of liquid crystal polymers is in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) on 
digital watches, flat-panel computer monitors and televisions, and other digital displays. 
Here cholesteric types of LCPs are employed which, at room temperature, are fluid 
liquids, transparent, and optically anisotropic. The displays are composed of two sheets 
of glass between which is sandwiched the liquid crystal material. The outer face of each 
glass sheet is coated with a transparent and electrically conductive film; in addition, 
the character-forming number/letter elements are etched into this film on the side that 
is to be viewed. A voltage applied through the conductive films (and thus between 
these two glass sheets) over one of these character-forming regions causes a disrup¬ 
tion of the orientation of the LCP molecules in this region, a darkening of this LCP 
material, and, in turn, the formation of a visible character. 

Some of the nematic type of liquid crystal polymers are rigid solids at room 
temperature and, on the basis of an outstanding combination of properties and pro¬ 
cessing characteristics, have found widespread use in a variety of commercial ap¬ 
plications. For example, these materials exhibit the following behaviors: 

1. Excellent thermal stability; they may be used to temperatures as high as 
230°C (450°F). 

2. Stiff and strong; their tensile moduli range between 10 and 24 GPa (1.4 X 10 6 
and 3.5 X 10 6 psi), and tensile strengths are from 125 to 255 MPa (18,000 to 
37,000 psi). 

3. High impact strengths, which are retained upon cooling to relatively low 
temperatures. 

4. Chemical inertness to a wide variety of acids, solvents, bleaches, and so on. 

5. Inherent flame resistance, and combustion products that are relatively nontoxic. 

The thermal stability and chemical inertness of these materials are explained by 
extremely high intermolecular interactions. 

The following may be said about their processing and fabrication characteristics: 

1. All conventional processing techniques available for thermoplastic materials 
may be used. 

2. Extremely low shrinkage and warpage take place during molding. 

3. Exceptional dimensional repeatability from part to part. 

4. Low melt viscosity, which permits molding of thin sections and/or complex 
shapes. 

5. Low heats of fusion; this results in rapid melting and subsequent cooling, 
which shortens molding cycle times. 

6. Anisotropic finished-part properties; molecular orientation effects are pro¬ 
duced from melt flow during molding. 

These materials are used extensively by the electronics industry (in intercon¬ 
nect devices, relay and capacitor housings, brackets, etc.), by the medical equipment 
industry (in components to be repeatedly sterilized), and in photocopiers and fiber¬ 
optic components. 

Thermoplastic Elastomers

in nature (Section 14.9). By way of contrast, most elastomers heretofore discussed 
are thermosets, because they are crosslinked during vulcanization. Of the several va¬ 
rieties of TPEs, one of the best known and widely used is a block copolymer consist¬ 
ing of block segments of a hard and rigid thermoplastic (commonly styrene [S]), that 
alternate with block segments of a soft and flexible elastic material (often butadiene 
[B] or isoprene [I]). For a common TPE, hard polymerized segments are located at 
chain ends, whereas each soft central region consists of polymerized butadiene or iso¬ 
prene units. These TPEs are frequently termed styrenic block copolymers, and chain 
chemistries for the two (S-B-S and S-I-S) types are shown in Figure 15.21. 

At ambient temperatures, the soft, amorphous, central (butadiene or isoprene) 
segments impart the rubbery, elastomeric behavior to the material. Furthermore, 
for temperatures below the T m of the hard (styrene) component, hard chain-end 
segments from numerous adjacent chains aggregate together to form rigid crys¬ 
talline domain regions. These domains are “physical crosslinks” that act as anchor 
points so as to restrict soft-chain segment motions; they function in much the same 
way as “chemical crosslinks” for the thermoset elastomers. A schematic illustration 
for the structure of this TPE type is presented in Figure 15.22.

15.20 Polymerization * 607 


The tensile modulus of this TPE material is subject to alteration; increasing the 
number of soft-component blocks per chain will lead to a decrease in modulus and, 
therefore, a diminishment of stiffness. Furthermore, the useful temperature range 
lies between T g of the soft and flexible component and T m of the hard, rigid one. 
For the styrenic block copolymers this range is between about -70°C (—95°F) and 
100°C (212°F). 

In addition to the styrenic block copolymers, there are other types of TPEs, in¬ 
cluding thermoplastic olefins, copolyesters, thermoplastic polyurethanes, and elas¬ 
tomeric polyamides. 

The chief advantage of the TPEs over the thermoset elastomers is that upon 
heating above T m of the hard phase, they melt (i.e., the physical crosslinks disap¬ 
pear), and, therefore, they may be processed by conventional thermoplastic form¬ 
ing techniques [blow molding, injection molding, etc. (Section 15.22)]; thermoset 
polymers do not experience melting, and, consequently, forming is normally more 
difficult. Furthermore, because the melting-solidification process is reversible and 
repeatable for thermoplastic elastomers, TPE parts may be reformed into other 
shapes. In other words, they are recyclable; thermoset elastomers are, to a large 
degree, nonrecyclable. Scrap that is generated during forming procedures may also 
be recycled, which results in lower production costs than with thermosets. In 
addition, tighter controls may be maintained on part dimensions for TPEs, and TPEs 
have lower densities. 

In quite a variety of applications, the thermoplastic elastomers have replaced 
the conventional thermoset elastomers. Typical uses for the TPEs include automo¬ 
tive exterior trim (bumpers, fascia, etc.), automotive underhood components (elec¬ 
trical insulation and connectors, and gaskets), shoe soles and heels, sporting goods 
(e.g., bladders for footballs and soccer balls), medical barrier films and protective 
coatings, and components in sealants, caulking, and adhesives. 

Polymer Synthesis and Processing 

The large macromolecules of the commercially useful polymers must be synthesized 
from substances having smaller molecules in a process termed polymerization. Fur¬ 
thermore, the properties of a polymer may be modified and enhanced by the inclu¬ 
sion of additive materials. Finally, a finished piece having a desired shape must be 
fashioned during a forming operation. This section treats polymerization processes 
and the various forms of additives, as well as specific forming procedures. 

15.20 POLYMERIZATION 

The synthesis of these large molecules (polymers) is termed polymerization; it 
is simply the process by which monomers are linked together to generate long chains 
composed of repeat units. Most generally, the raw materials for synthetic polymers 
are derived from coal, natural gas, and petroleum products. The reactions by which 
polymerization occur are grouped into two general classifications—addition and 
condensation—according to the reaction mechanism, as discussed next. 

Addition Polymerization 

Addition polymerization (sometimes called chain reaction polymerization) is a process 
by which monomer units are attached one at a time in chainlike fashion to form a 
linear macromolecule. The composition of the resultant product molecule is an ex¬ 
act multiple of that of the original reactant monomer.

608 * Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 


Three distinct stages—initiation, propagation, and termination—are involved in 
addition polymerization. During the initiation step, an active center capable of prop¬ 
agation is formed by a reaction between an initiator (or catalyst) species and the 
monomer unit. This process has already been demonstrated for polyethylene (Equa¬ 
tion 14.1), which is repeated as follows: 

H H H H 

I I I I 

R- + C = C -> R —C —C- (15.5) 

I I I I 

H H H H 


Again, R- represents the active initiator, and • is an unpaired electron. 

Propagation involves the linear growth of the polymer chain by the sequential 
addition of monomer units to this active growing chain molecule. This may be rep¬ 
resented, again for polyethylene, as follows: 

HHHH HHHH 

i i i i i i i i 

R— C —C- + C = C -» R —C —C —C —C- (15.6) 

I I I I I I I I 

HHHH HHHH 


Chain growth is relatively rapid; the period required to grow a molecule consisting 
of, say, 1000 repeat units is on the order of 10 -2 to 10 -3 s. 

Propagation may end or terminate in different ways. First, the active ends of 
two propagating chains may link together to form one molecule according to the 
following reaction: 6

two “dead chains” as 7

thus terminating the growth of each chain. 

Molecular weight is governed by the relative rates of initiation, propagation, 
and termination. Ordinarily, they are controlled to ensure the production of a poly¬ 
mer having the desired degree of polymerization. 


6 This type of termination reaction is referred to as combination.

Condensation Polymerization 

Condensation (or step reaction) polymerization is the formation of polymers by step¬ 
wise intermolecular chemical reactions that may involve more than one monomer 
species. There is usually a small molecular weight by-product such as water that is 
eliminated (or condensed). No reactant species has the chemical formula of the re¬ 
peat unit, and the intermolecular reaction occurs every time a repeat unit is formed. 
For example, consider the formation of the polyester poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
(PET), from the reaction between ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid; the inter¬ 
molecular reaction is as follows: 


Ethylene glycol Terephthalic acid

This stepwise process is successively repeated, producing a linear molecule. The 
chemistry of the specific reaction is not important, but the condensation polymer¬ 
ization mechanism is. Furthermore, reaction times for condensation are generally 
longer than for addition polymerization. 

For the previous condensation reaction, both ethylene glycol and terephthalic 
acid are bifunctional. However, condensation reactions can include trifunctional or 
higher functional monomers capable of forming crosslinked and network polymers. 
The thermosetting polyesters and phenol-formaldehyde, the nylons, and the 
polycarbonates are produced by condensation polymerization. Some polymers, such 
as nylon, may be polymerized by either technique.

POLYMER ADDITIVES 

Most of the properties of polymers discussed earlier in this chapter are intrinsic 
ones—that is, characteristic of or fundamental to the specific polymer. Some of these 
properties are related to and controlled by the molecular structure. Many times, 
however, it is necessary to modify the mechanical, chemical, and physical proper¬ 
ties to a much greater degree than is possible by the simple alteration of this 
fundamental molecular structure. Foreign substances called additives are intention¬ 
ally introduced to enhance or modify many of these properties, and thus render a 
polymer more serviceable. Typical additives include filler materials, plasticizers, 
stabilizers, colorants, and flame retardants. 

Fillers 

Filler materials are most often added to polymers to improve tensile and compres¬ 
sive strengths, abrasion resistance, toughness, dimensional and thermal stability, and 
other properties. Materials used as particulate fillers include wood flour (finely 
powdered sawdust), silica flour and sand, glass, clay, talc, limestone, and even some 
synthetic polymers. Particle sizes range all the way from 10 nm to macroscopic 
dimensions. Polymers that contain fillers may also be classified as composite 
materials, which are discussed in Chapter 16. Often the fillers are inexpensive ma¬ 
terials that replace some volume of the more expensive polymer, reducing the cost 
of the final product. 

Plasticizers 

The flexibility, ductility, and toughness of polymers may be improved with the aid 
of additives called plasticizers. Their presence also produces reductions in hardness 
and stiffness. Plasticizers are generally liquids having low vapor pressures and low 
molecular weights. The small plasticizer molecules occupy positions between the 
large polymer chains, effectively increasing the interchain distance with a reduction 
in the secondary intermolecular bonding. Plasticizers are commonly used in poly¬ 
mers that are intrinsically brittle at room temperature, such as poly(vinyl chloride) 
and some of the acetate copolymers. The plasticizer lowers the glass transition tem¬ 
perature, so that at ambient conditions the polymers may be used in applications 
requiring some degree of pliability and ductility. These applications include thin 
sheets or films, tubing, raincoats, and curtains.

Stabilizers 

Some polymeric materials, under normal environmental conditions, are subject to 
rapid deterioration, generally in terms of mechanical integrity. Additives that coun¬ 
stabilizer teract deteriorative processes are called stabilizers. 

One common form of deterioration results from exposure to light [in particu¬ 
lar ultraviolet (UV) radiation]. Ultraviolet radiation interacts with and causes a sev¬ 
erance of some of the covalent bonds along the molecular chains, which may also 
result in some crosslinking. There are two primary approaches to UV stabilization. 
The first is to add a UV-absorbent material, often as a thin layer at the surface. This 
essentially acts as a sunscreen and blocks out the UV radiation before it can pen¬ 
etrate into and damage the polymer. The second approach is to add materials that 
react with the bonds broken by UV radiation before they can participate in other 
reactions that lead to additional polymer damage. 

Another important type of deterioration is oxidation (Section 17.12). It is a con¬ 
sequence of the chemical interaction between oxygen [as either diatomic oxygen 
(0 2 ) or ozone (0 3 )] and the polymer molecules. Stabilizers that protect against ox¬ 
idation either consume oxygen before it reaches the polymer and/or prevent the 
occurrence of oxidation reactions that would further damage the material. 

Colorants 

colorant Colorants impart a specific color to a polymer; they may be added in the form of 

dyes or pigments. The molecules in a dye actually dissolve in the polymer. Pigments 
are filler materials that do not dissolve, but remain as a separate phase; normally 
they have a small particle size and a refractive index near that of the parent poly¬ 
mer. Others may impart opacity as well as color to the polymer. 

Flame Retardants 

The flammability of polymeric materials is a major concern, especially in the manufac¬ 
ture of textiles and children’s toys. Most polymers are flammable in their pure form; 
exceptions include those containing significant contents of chlorine and/or fluorine, such 
as poly(vinyl chloride) and polytetrafluoroethylene. The flammability resistance of the 
flame retardant remaining combustible polymers may be enhanced by additives called flame retardants. 

These retardants may function by interfering with the combustion process through the 
gas phase, or by initiating a different combustion reaction that generates less heat, 
thereby reducing the temperature; this causes a slowing or cessation of burning. 

15.22 FORMING TECHNIQUES FOR PLASTICS 

Quite a variety of different techniques are employed in the forming of polymeric 
materials. The method used for a specific polymer depends on several factors: 
(1) whether the material is thermoplastic or thermosetting; (2) if thermoplastic, the 





612 * Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 


molding 


temperature at which it softens; (3) the atmospheric stability of the material being 
formed; and (4) the geometry and size of the finished product. There are numerous 
similarities between some of these techniques and those used for fabricating met¬ 
als and ceramics. 

Fabrication of polymeric materials normally occurs at elevated temperatures 
and often by the application of pressure. Thermoplastics are formed above their 
glass transition temperatures, if amorphous, or above their melting temperatures, if 
semicrystalline. An applied pressure must be maintained as the piece is cooled so 
that the formed article will retain its shape. One significant economic benefit of us¬ 
ing thermoplastics is that they may be recycled; scrap thermoplastic pieces may be 
remelted and re-formed into new shapes. 

Fabrication of thermosetting polymers is ordinarily accomplished in two stages. 
First comes the preparation of a linear polymer (sometimes called a prepolymer) 
as a liquid having a low molecular weight. This material is converted into the final 
hard and stiff product during the second stage, which is normally carried out in a 
mold having the desired shape. This second stage, termed curing, may occur during 
heating and/or by the addition of catalysts, and often under pressure. During cur¬ 
ing, chemical and structural changes occur on a molecular level: a crosslinked or a 
network structure forms. After curing, thermoset polymers may be removed from 
a mold while still hot, because they are now dimensionally stable. Thermosets are 
difficult to recycle, do not melt, are usable at higher temperatures than thermoplas¬ 
tics, and are often more chemically inert. 

Molding is the most common method for forming plastic polymers. The several 
molding techniques used include compression, transfer, blow, injection, and extrusion 
molding. For each, a finely pelletized or granulized plastic is forced, at an elevated tem¬ 
perature and by pressure, to flow into, fill, and assume the shape of a mold cavity. 

Compression and Transfer Molding 

For compression molding, the appropriate amounts of thoroughly mixed polymer 
and necessary additives are placed between male and female mold members, as 
illustrated in Figure 15.23. Both mold pieces are heated; however, only one is mov¬ 
able. The mold is closed, and heat and pressure are applied, causing the plastic to 
become viscous and flow to conform to the mold shape. Before molding, raw ma¬ 
terials may be mixed and cold-pressed into a disc, which is called a preform. 
Preheating of the preform reduces molding time and pressure, extends the die life¬ 
time, and produces a more uniform finished piece. This molding technique lends

itself to the fabrication of both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers; however, 
its use with thermoplastics is more time-consuming and expensive than the more 
commonly used extrusion or injection molding techniques discussed next. 

In transfer molding, a variation of compression molding, the solid ingredients are 
first melted in a heated transfer chamber. As the molten material is injected into the 
mold chamber, the pressure is distributed more uniformly over all surfaces. This process 
is used with thermosetting polymers and for pieces having complex geometries. 

Injection Molding 

Injection molding, the polymer analogue of die casting for metals, is the most widely 
used technique for fabricating thermoplastic materials. A schematic cross section of 
the apparatus used is illustrated in Figure 15.24. The correct amount of pelletized ma¬ 
terial is fed from a feed hopper into a cylinder by the motion of a plunger or ram. This 
charge is pushed forward into a heating chamber where it is forced around a spreader 
so as to make better contact with the heated wall. As a result, the thermoplastic ma¬ 
terial melts to form a viscous liquid. Next, the molten plastic is impelled, again by ram 
motion, through a nozzle into the enclosed mold cavity; pressure is maintained until 
the molding has solidified. Finally, the mold is opened, the piece is ejected, the mold 
is closed, and the entire cycle is repeated. Probably the most outstanding feature of 
this technique is the speed with which pieces may be produced. For thermoplastics, so¬ 
lidification of the injected charge is almost immediate; consequently, cycle times for 
this process are short (commonly within the range of 10 to 30 s). Thermosetting poly¬ 
mers may also be injection molded; curing takes place while the material is under pres¬ 
sure in a heated mold, which results in longer cycle times than for thermoplastics. This 
process is sometimes termed reaction injection molding (RIM) and is commonly used 
for materials such as polyurethane. 

Extrusion 

The extrusion process is the molding of a viscous thermoplastic under pressure through 
an open-ended die, similar to the extrusion of metals (Figure 11.8c). A mechanical screw 
or auger propels through a chamber the pelletized material, which is successively com¬ 
pacted, melted, and formed into a continuous charge of viscous fluid (Figure 15.25). 
Extrusion takes place as this molten mass is forced through a die orifice. Solidification 
of the extruded length is expedited by blowers, a water spray, or bath. The technique 
is especially adapted to producing continuous lengths having constant cross-sectional 
geometries—for example, rods, tubes, hose channels, sheets, and filaments. 

Blow Molding 

The blow-molding process for the fabrication of plastic containers is similar to that 
used for blowing glass bottles, as represented in Figure 13.8. First, a parison, or 
length of polymer tubing, is extruded. While still in a semimolten state, the parison

Structural parts

is placed in a two-piece mold having the desired container configuration. The 
hollow piece is formed by blowing air or steam under pressure into the parison, 
forcing the tube walls to conform to the contours of the mold. Of course the tem¬ 
perature and viscosity of the parison must be carefully regulated. 

Casting 

Like metals, polymeric materials may be cast, as when a molten plastic material is 
poured into a mold and allowed to solidify. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting 
plastics may be cast. For thermoplastics, solidification occurs upon cooling from the 
molten state; however, for thermosets, hardening is a consequence of the actual poly¬ 
merization or curing process, which is usually carried out at an elevated temperature. 

15.23 FABRICATION OF ELASTOMERS 

Techniques used in the actual fabrication of rubber parts are essentially the same 
as those discussed for plastics as described previously—that is, compression mold¬ 
ing, extrusion, and so on. Furthermore, most rubber materials are vulcanized (Sec¬ 
tion 15.9) and some are reinforced with carbon black (Section 16.2). 



Check 15.14 


For a rubber component that is to be vulcanized in its final form, should vulcaniza¬ 
tion be carried out before or after the forming operation? Why? Hint: you may

15.24 FABRICATION OF FIBERS AND FILMS 

Fibers 

spinning The process by which fibers are formed from bulk polymer material is termed spinning. 

Most often, fibers are spun from the molten state in a process called melt spinning. The 
material to be spun is first heated until it forms a relatively viscous liquid. Next, it is 
pumped through a plate called a spinneret, which contains numerous small, typically 
round holes. As the molten material passes through each of these orifices, a single fiber 
is formed, which is rapidly solidified by cooling with air blowers or a water bath. 







































15.24 Fabrication of Fibers and Films * 615 


The crystallinity of a spun fiber will depend on its rate of cooling during spin¬ 
ning. The strength of fibers is improved by a postforming process called drawing, 
as discussed in Section 15.8. Again, drawing is simply the permanent mechanical 
elongation of a fiber in the direction of its axis. During this process the molecular 
chains become oriented in the direction of drawing (Figure 15.13d), such that the 
tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and toughness are improved. The cross sec¬ 
tion of melt-spun, drawn fibers is nearly circular, and the properties are uniform 
throughout the cross section. 

Two other techniques that involve producing fibers from solutions of dissolved 
polymers are dry spinning and wet spinning. For dry spinning the polymer is dis¬ 
solved in a volatile solvent. The polymer-solvent solution is then pumped through a 
spinneret into a heated zone; here the fibers solidify as the solvent evaporates. In 
wet spinning, the fibers are formed by passing a polymer-solvent solution through a 
spinneret directly into a second solvent that causes the polymer fiber to come out 
of (i.e., precipitate from) the solution. For both of these techniques, a skin first forms 
on the surface of the fiber. Subsequently, some shrinkage occurs such that the fiber 
shrivels up (like a raisin); this leads to a very irregular cross-section profile, which 
causes the fiber to become stiffer (i.e., increases the modulus of elasticity). 

Films 

Many films are simply extruded through a thin die slit; this may be followed by a rolling 
(calendering) or drawing operation that serves to reduce thickness and improve 
strength. Alternatively, film may be blown: continuous tubing is extruded through an 
annular die; then, by maintaining a carefully controlled positive gas pressure inside the 
tube and by drawing the film in the axial direction as it emerges from the die, the ma¬ 
terial expands around this trapped air bubble like a balloon (Figure 15.26). As a re¬ 
sult the wall thickness is continuously reduced to produce a thin cylindrical film that 
can be sealed at the end to make garbage bags, or may be cut and laid flat to make a 
film. This is termed a biaxial drawing process and produces films that are strong in 
both stretching directions. Some of the newer films are produced by coextrusion; that 
is, multilayers of more than one polymer type are extruded simultaneously.

SUMMARY 


Stress-Strain Behavior 

• On the basis of stress-strain behavior, polymers fall within three general 
classifications (Figure 15.1): brittle (curve A), plastic (curve B ), and highly 
elastic (curve C). 

• Polymers are neither as strong nor as stiff as metals. However, their high flexibil¬ 
ities, low densities, and resistance to corrosion make them the materials of choice 
for many applications. 

• The mechanical properties of polymers are sensitive to changes in temperature 
and strain rate. With either rising temperature or decreasing strain rate, modulus 
of elasticity diminishes, tensile strength decreases, and ductility increases. 


Viscoelastic Deformation 

• Viscoelastic mechanical behavior, being intermediate between totally elastic and 
totally viscous, is displayed by a number of polymeric materials. 

• This behavior is characterized by the relaxation modulus, a time-dependent mod¬ 
ulus of elasticity. 

• Magnitude of the relaxation modulus is very sensitive to temperature. Glassy, 
leathery, rubbery, and viscous flow regions may be identified on a plot of loga¬ 
rithm of relaxation modulus versus temperature (Figure 15.7). 

• The logarithm of relaxation modulus versus temperature behavior will depend 
on molecular configuration—degree of crystallinity, presence of crosslinking, and 
so on. (Figure 15.8). 


Fracture of Polymers 

• Fracture strengths of polymeric materials are low relative to metals and ceramics. 

• Both brittle and ductile fracture modes are possible. 

• Some thermoplastic materials experience a ductile-to-brittle transition with a low¬ 
ering of temperature, an increase in strain rate, and/or an alteration of specimen 
thickness or geometry. 

• In some thermoplastics, the crack-formation process may be preceded by craz¬ 
ing; crazes are regions of localized deformation and the presence of microvoids 
(Figure 15.9). 

• Crazing can lead to an increase in ductility and toughness of the material. 


Deformation of Semicrystalline Polymers 

• During the elastic deformation of a semicrystalline polymer having a spherulitic 
structure that is stressed in tension, the molecules in amorphous regions elongate 
in the stress direction (Figure 15.12). 

• The tensile plastic deformation of spherulitic polymers occurs in several stages 
as both amorphous tie chains and chain-folded block segments (which sepa¬ 
rate from the ribbonlike lamellae) become oriented with the tensile axis 
(Figure 15.13). 

• Also, during deformation the shapes of spherulites are altered (for moderate de¬ 
formations); relatively large degrees of deformation lead to a complete destruc¬ 
tion of the spherulites to form highly aligned structures.

Factors That Influence the Mechanical Properties of Semicrystalline Polymers 

• The mechanical behavior of a polymer will be influenced by both in-service and 
structural/processing factors. 

• Increasing the temperature and/or diminishing the strain rate leads to reductions 
in tensile modulus and tensile strength and an enhancement of ductility. 

• Other factors affect the mechanical properties: 

Molecular weight—Tensile modulus is relatively insensitive to molecular weight. 
However, tensile strength increases with increasing M n (Equation 15.3). 

Degree of crystallinity—Both tensile modulus and strength increase with in¬ 
creasing percent crystallinity. 

Predeformation by drawing—Stiffness and strength are enhanced by perma¬ 
nently deforming the polymer in tension. 

Heat-treating—Heat-treating undrawn and semicrystalline polymers leads to 
increases in stiffness and strength and a decrease in ductility. 


Deformation of Elastomers 

• Large elastic extensions are possible for elastomeric materials that are amorphous 
and lightly crosslinked. 

• Deformation corresponds to the unkinking and uncoiling of chains in response 
to an applied tensile stress. 

• Crosslinking is often achieved during a vulcanization process; increased crosslinking 
enhances modulus of elasticity and tensile strength of the elastomer. 

• Many of the elastomers are copolymers, whereas the silicone elastomers are re¬ 
ally inorganic materials. 


Crystallization 

• During the crystallization of a polymer, randomly oriented molecules in the liq¬ 
uid phase transform into chain-folded crystallites that have ordered and aligned 
molecular structures. 


Melting 

• The melting of crystalline regions of a polymer corresponds to the transforma¬ 
tion of a solid material, having an ordered structure of aligned molecular chains, 
to a viscous liquid in which the structure is highly random. 

The Glass Transition 

• The glass transition occurs in amorphous regions of polymers. 

• Upon cooling, this phenomenon corresponds to the gradual transformation from 
a liquid to a rubbery material, and finally to a rigid solid. With decreasing tem¬ 
perature there is a reduction in the motion of large segments of molecular chains. 


Melting and Glass Transition Temperatures 

• Melting and glass transition temperatures may be determined from plots of 
specific volume versus temperature (Figure 15.18). 

• These parameters are important relative to the temperature range over which a 
particular polymer may be used and processed. 


618 * Chapter 15 / Characteristics, Applications, and Processing of Polymers 

Factors That Influence Melting and Glass Transition Temperatures 

• The magnitudes of T m and T g increase with increasing chain stiffness; stiffness is 
enhanced by the presence of chain double bonds and side groups that are either 
bulky or polar. 

• At low molecular weights T m and T g increase with increasing M. 

Polymer Types 

• One way of classifying polymeric materials is according to their end use. Accord¬ 
ing to this scheme, the several types include plastics, fibers, coatings, adhesives, 
films, foams, and advanced. 

• Plastic materials are perhaps the most widely used group of polymers, which in¬ 
clude the following: polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), poly¬ 
styrene, and the fluorocarbons, epoxies, phenolics, and polyesters. 

• Many polymeric materials may be spun into fibers, which are used primarily in 
textiles. Mechanical, thermal, and chemical characteristics of these materials are 
especially critical. 

• Three advanced polymeric materials were discussed: ultra-high-molecular-weight 
polyethylene, liquid crystal polymers, and thermoplastic elastomers. These materi¬ 
als have unusual properties and are used in a host of high-technology applications. 

Polymerization 

• Synthesis of large-molecular-weight polymers is attained by polymerization, of 
which there are two types: addition and condensation. 

For addition polymerization, monomer units are attached one at a time in 
chainlike fashion to form a linear molecule. 

Condensation polymerization involves stepwise intermolecular chemical re¬ 
actions that may include more than a single molecular species. 

Polymer Additives 

• The properties of polymers may be further modified by using additives; these in¬ 
clude fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, colorants, and flame retardants. 

Fillers are added to improve the strength, abrasion resistance, toughness, and 
or thermal/dimensional stability of polymers. 

Flexibility, ductility, and toughness are enhanced by the addition of plasticizers. 

Stabilizers counteract deteriorative processes due to exposure to light and 
gaseous species in the atmosphere. 

Colorants are used to impart specific colors to polymers. 

The flammability resistance of polymers is enhanced by the incorporation of 
flame retardants. 

Forming Techniques for Plastics 

• Fabrication of plastic polymers is usually accomplished by shaping the material 
in molten form at an elevated temperature, using at least one of several differ¬ 
ent molding techniques —compression (Figure 15.23), transfer, injection (Figure 
15.24), and blow. Extrusion (Figure 15.25) and casting are also possible. 

Fabrication of Fibers and Films 

• Some fibers are spun from a viscous melt or solution, after which they are plasti¬ 
cally elongated during a drawing operation, which improves the mechanical strength. 

• Films are formed by extrusion and blowing (Figure 15.26) or by calendering.

aspects of materials. We have also generated a processing/structure/properties/

From the stress-strain data for poly(methyl 
methacrylate) shown in Figure 15.3, deter¬ 
mine the modulus of elasticity and tensile 
strength at room temperature [20°C (68°F)], 
and compare these values with those given in 
Table 15.1. 

Compute the elastic moduli for the following 
polymers, whose stress-strain behaviors may 
be observed in the “Tensile Tests” module of 
Virtual Materials Science and Engineering 
(VMSE): (a) high-density polyethylene, (b) ny¬ 
lon, and (c) phenol-formaldehyde (Bakelite). 
How do these values compare with those pre¬ 
sented in Table 15.1 for the same polymers? 

For the nylon polymer, whose stress-strain be¬ 
havior may be observed in the “Tensile Tests” 
module of Virtual Materials Science and Engi¬ 
neering (VMSE), determine the following:

where aft) and <x(0) represent the time- 
dependent and initial (i.e., time = 0) stresses, 
respectively, and t and r denote elapsed time 
and the relaxation time; r is a time- 
independent constant characteristic of the 
material. A specimen of a viscoelastic poly¬ 
mer whose stress relaxation obeys Equation 
15.10 was suddenly pulled in tension to a 
measured strain of 0.6; the stress necessary 
to maintain this constant strain was measured 
as a function of time. Determine E r ( 10) for 
this material if the initial stress level was 
2.76 MPa (400 psi), which dropped to 
1.72 MPa (250 psi) after 60 s.

the logarithm of time is plotted for poly¬ 
isobutylene at a variety of temperatures.

WHY STUDY Composites? 


With a knowledge of the various types of composites, 
as well as an understanding of the dependence of 
their behaviors on the characteristics, relative amounts, 
geometry/distribution, and properties of the con¬ 
stituent phases, it is possible to design materials with 


property combinations that are better than those 
found in any monolithic metal alloys, ceramics, and 
polymeric materials. For example, in Design Example 
16 . 1 , we discuss how a tubular shaft is designed that 
meets specified stiffness requirements.

16.1 INTRODUCTION 

The advent of the composites as a distinct classification of materials began dur¬ 
ing the mid-20th century with the manufacturing of deliberately designed and 
engineered multiphase composites such as fiberglass-reinforced polymers. Al¬ 
though multiphase materials, such as wood, bricks made from straw-reinforced 
clay, seashells, and even alloys such as steel had been known for millennia, recog¬ 
nition of this novel concept of combining together dissimilar materials during 
manufacture led to the identification of composites as a new class that was sep¬ 
arate from the familiar metals, ceramics, and polymers. We now realize that this 
concept of multiphase composites provides exciting opportunities for designing 
an exceedingly large variety of materials with property combinations that can¬ 
not be met by any of the monolithic conventional metal alloys, ceramics, and 
polymeric materials. 1 


: By monolithic we mean having a microstructure that is uniform and continuous and was 
formed from a single material; furthermore, more than one microconstituent may be pres¬ 
ent. Contrastingly, the microstructure of a composite is non-uniform, discontinuous, and 
multiphase, in the sense that it is a mixture of two or more distinct materials.

Materials that have specific and unusual properties are needed for a host of 
high-technology applications such as those found in the aerospace, underwater, bio¬ 
engineering, and transportation industries. For example, aircraft engineers are in¬ 
creasingly searching for structural materials that have low densities; are strong, stiff, 
and abrasion and impact resistant; and do not easily corrode. This is a rather for¬ 
midable combination of characteristics. Among monolithic materials, strong mate¬ 
rials are relatively dense; increasing the strength or stiffness generally results in a 
decrease in toughness. 

Material property combinations and ranges have been, and are yet being, 
extended by the development of composite materials. Generally speaking, a 
composite is considered to be any multiphase material that exhibits a signifi¬ 
cant proportion of the properties of both constituent phases such that a better 
combination of properties is realized. According to this principle of combined 
action, better property combinations are fashioned by the judicious combination 
of two or more distinct materials. Property trade-offs are also made for many 
composites. 

Composites of sorts have already been discussed; these include multiphase 
metal alloys, ceramics, and polymers. For example, pearlitic steels (Section 9.19) 
have a microstructure consisting of alternating layers of a-ferrite and cementite 
(Figure 9.27). The ferrite phase is soft and ductile, whereas cementite is hard and 
very brittle. The combined mechanical characteristics of the pearlite (reasonably 
high ductility and strength) are superior to those of either of the constituent phases. 
A number of composites also occur in nature. For example, wood consists of strong 
and flexible cellulose fibers surrounded and held together by a stiffer material called 
lignin. Also, bone is a composite of the strong yet soft protein collagen and the hard, 
brittle mineral apatite. 

A composite, in the present context, is a multiphase material that is arti¬ 
ficially made, as opposed to one that occurs or forms naturally. In addition, the 
constituent phases must be chemically dissimilar and separated by a distinct 
interface. 

In designing composite materials, scientists and engineers have ingeniously com¬ 
bined various metals, ceramics, and polymers to produce a new generation of ex¬ 
traordinary materials. Most composites have been created to improve combinations 
of mechanical characteristics such as stiffness, toughness, and ambient and high- 
temperature strength. 

Many composite materials are composed of just two phases; one is termed the 
matrix, which is continuous and surrounds the other phase, often called the dis¬ 
persed phase. The properties of composites are a function of the properties of the 
constituent phases, their relative amounts, and the geometry of the dispersed phase. 
Dispersed phase geometry in this context means the shape of the particles and the 
particle size, distribution, and orientation; these characteristics are represented in 
Figure 16.1. 

One simple scheme for the classification of composite materials is shown in 
Figure 16.2, which consists of three main divisions: particle-reinforced, fiber-reinforced, 
and structural composites; also, at least two subdivisions exist for each. The dis¬ 
persed phase for particle-reinforced composites is equiaxed (i.e., particle dimensions 
are approximately the same in all directions); for fiber-reinforced composites, the 
dispersed phase has the geometry of a fiber (i.e., a large length-to-diameter ratio). 
Structural composites are combinations of composites and homogeneous materials. 
The discussion of the remainder of this chapter will be organized according to this 
classification scheme.

As noted in Figure 16.2, large-particle and dispersion-strengthened composites are 
the two subclassifications of particle-reinforced composites. The distinction between 
these is based on reinforcement or strengthening mechanism. The term large is used 
to indicate that particle-matrix interactions cannot be treated on the atomic or mo¬ 
lecular level; rather, continuum mechanics is used. For most of these composites, 
the particulate phase is harder and stiffer than the matrix. These reinforcing parti¬ 
cles tend to restrain movement of the matrix phase in the vicinity of each particle. 
In essence, the matrix transfers some of the applied stress to the particles, which 
bear a fraction of the load. The degree of reinforcement or improvement of me¬ 
chanical behavior depends on strong bonding at the matrix-particle interface.

For dispersion-strengthened composites, particles are normally much smaller, 
with diameters between 0.01 and 0.1 p,m (10 and 100 nm). Particle-matrix interac¬ 
tions that lead to strengthening occur on the atomic or molecular level. The mech¬ 
anism of strengthening is similar to that for precipitation hardening discussed in 
Section 11.9. Whereas the matrix bears the major portion of an applied load, the 
small dispersed particles hinder or impede the motion of dislocations. Thus, plastic 
deformation is restricted such that yield and tensile strengths, as well as hardness, 
improve. 

PARTICLE COMPOSITES 

Some polymeric materials to which fillers have been added (Section 15.21) are re¬ 
ally large-particle composites. Again, the fillers modify or improve the properties 
of the material and/or replace some of the polymer volume with a less expensive 
material—the filler. 

Another familiar large-particle composite is concrete, which is composed of ce¬ 
ment (the matrix) and sand and gravel (the particulates). Concrete is the discussion 
topic of a succeeding section. 

Particles can have quite a variety of geometries, but they should be of approx¬ 
imately the same dimension in all directions (equiaxed). For effective reinforce¬ 
ment, the particles should be small and evenly distributed throughout the matrix. 
Furthermore, the volume fraction of the two phases influences the behavior; mechan¬ 
ical properties are enhanced with increasing particulate content. Two mathematical 
expressions have been formulated for the dependence of the elastic modulus on the 
volume fraction of the constituent phases for a two-phase composite. These rule-of- 
mixtures equations predict that the elastic modulus should fall between an upper 
bound represented by 


E c {u) = E m V m + E p V p 


(16.1) 


and a lower bound, or limit, 


m = 


EmE p 

V m Ep + V p E m 


(16.2) 


In these expressions, E and V denote the elastic modulus and volume fraction, re¬ 
spectively, whereas the subscripts c, m, and p represent composite, matrix, and par¬ 
ticulate phases. Figure 16.3 plots upper- and lower-bound E c -versus-Vp curves for a 
copper-tungsten composite, in which tungsten is the particulate phase; experimen¬ 
tal data points fall between the two curves. Equations analogous to 16.1 and 16.2 
for fiber-reinforced composites are derived in Section 16.5. 

Large-particle composites are used with all three material types (metals, poly¬ 
mers, and ceramics). The cermets are examples of ceramic-metal composites. The 
most common cermet is cemented carbide, which is composed of extremely hard 
particles of a refractory carbide ceramic such as tungsten carbide (WC) or titanium 
carbide (TiC), embedded in a matrix of a metal such as cobalt or nickel. These com¬ 
posites are used extensively as cutting tools for hardened steels. The hard carbide 
particles provide the cutting surface but, being extremely brittle, are not themselves 
capable of withstanding the cutting stresses. Toughness is enhanced by their inclu¬ 
sion in the ductile metal matrix, which isolates the carbide particles from one an¬ 
other and prevents particle-to-particle crack propagation. Both matrix and particulate

phases are quite refractory, to withstand the high temperatures generated by the cut¬ 
ting action on materials that are extremely hard. No single material could possibly 
provide the combination of properties possessed by a cermet. Relatively large vol¬ 
ume fractions of the particulate phase may be used, often exceeding 90 vol%; thus 
the abrasive action of the composite is maximized. A photomicrograph of a WC-Co 
cemented carbide is shown in Figure 16.4. 

Both elastomers and plastics are frequently reinforced with various particulate 
materials. Our use of many of the modern rubbers would be severely restricted with¬ 
out reinforcing particulate materials such as carbon black. Carbon black consists of 
very small and essentially spherical particles of carbon, produced by the combus¬ 
tion of natural gas or oil in an atmosphere that has only a limited air supply. When 
added to vulcanized rubber, this extremely inexpensive material enhances tensile 
strength, toughness, and tear and abrasion resistance. Automobile tires contain on 
the order of 15 to 30 vol% carbon black. For the carbon black to provide signifi¬ 
cant reinforcement, the particle size must be extremely small, with diameters be¬ 
tween 20 and 50 nm; also, the particles must be evenly distributed throughout the

inforcement using other materials (e.g., silica) is much less effective because this 
special interaction between the rubber molecules and particle surfaces does not 
exist. Figure 16.5 is an electron micrograph of a carbon black-reinforced rubber. 

Concrete 

Concrete is a common large-particle composite in which both matrix and dispersed 
phases are ceramic materials. Because the terms concrete and cement are sometimes 
incorrectly interchanged, perhaps it is appropriate to make a distinction between them. 
In a broad sense, concrete implies a composite material consisting of an aggregate of 
particles that are bound together in a solid body by some type of binding medium, that 
is, a cement. The two most familiar concretes are those made with portland and as¬ 
phaltic cements, in which the aggregate is gravel and sand. Asphaltic concrete is widely 
used primarily as a paving material, whereas portland cement concrete is employed ex¬ 
tensively as a structural building material. Only the latter is treated in this discussion. 

Portland Cement Concrete 

The ingredients for this concrete are portland cement, a fine aggregate (sand), a 
coarse aggregate (gravel), and water. The process by which portland cement is pro¬ 
duced and the mechanism of setting and hardening were discussed very briefly in 
Section 13.7. The aggregate particles act as a filler material to reduce the overall 
cost of the concrete product because they are cheap, whereas cement is relatively 
expensive. To achieve the optimum strength and workability of a concrete mixture, 
the ingredients must be added in the correct proportions. Dense packing of the ag¬ 
gregate and good interfacial contact are achieved by having particles of two dif¬ 
ferent sizes; the fine particles of sand should fill the void spaces between the gravel 
particles. Ordinarily these aggregates constitute between 60% and 80% of the total 
volume. The amount of cement-water paste should be sufficient to coat all the sand 
and gravel particles; otherwise, the cementitious bond will be incomplete. Further¬ 
more, all the constituents should be thoroughly mixed. Complete bonding be¬ 
tween cement and the aggregate particles is contingent on the addition of the correct 




16.2 Large-Particle Composites * 633 


prestressed concrete 


quantity of water. Too little water leads to incomplete bonding, and too much results 
in excessive porosity; in either case, the final strength is less than the optimum. 

The character of the aggregate particles is an important consideration. In par¬ 
ticular, the size distribution of the aggregates influences the amount of cement-water 
paste required. Also, the surfaces should be clean and free from clay and silt, which 
prevent the formation of a sound bond at the particle surface. 

Portland cement concrete is a major material of construction, primarily because 
it can be poured in place and hardens at room temperature, and even when sub¬ 
merged in water. However, as a structural material, it has some limitations and dis¬ 
advantages. Like most ceramics, portland cement concrete is relatively weak and 
extremely brittle; its tensile strength is approximately one-fifteenth to one-tenth its 
compressive strength. Also, large concrete structures can experience considerable 
thermal expansion and contraction with temperature fluctuations. In addition, water 
penetrates into external pores, which can cause severe cracking in cold weather as 
a consequence of freeze-thaw cycles. Most of these inadequacies may be eliminated 
or at least improved by reinforcement and/or the incorporation of additives. 

Reinforced Concrete 

The strength of portland cement concrete may be increased by additional rein¬ 
forcement. This is usually accomplished by means of steel rods, wires, bars (rebar), 
or mesh, which are embedded into the fresh and uncured concrete. Thus, the rein¬ 
forcement renders the hardened structure capable of supporting greater tensile, 
compressive, and shear stresses. Even if cracks develop in the concrete, consider¬ 
able reinforcement is maintained. 

Steel serves as a suitable reinforcement material because its coefficient of ther¬ 
mal expansion is nearly the same as that of concrete. In addition, steel is not rap¬ 
idly corroded in the cement environment, and a relatively strong adhesive bond is 
formed between it and the cured concrete. This adhesion may be enhanced by the 
incorporation of contours into the surface of the steel member, which permits a 
greater degree of mechanical interlocking. 

Portland cement concrete may also be reinforced by mixing into the fresh con¬ 
crete fibers of a high-modulus material such as glass, steel, nylon, or polyethylene. 
Care must be exercised in using this type of reinforcement because some fiber ma¬ 
terials experience rapid deterioration when exposed to the cement environment. 

Still another reinforcement technique for strengthening concrete involves the 
introduction of residual compressive stresses into the structural member; the re¬ 
sulting material is called prestressed concrete. This method uses one characteristic 
of brittle ceramics—namely, that they are stronger in compression than in tension. 
Thus, to fracture a prestressed concrete member, the magnitude of the precom- 
pressive stress must be exceeded by an applied tensile stress. 

In one such prestressing technique, high-strength steel wires are positioned inside 
the empty molds and stretched with a high tensile force, which is maintained con¬ 
stant. After the concrete has been placed and allowed to harden, the tension is re¬ 
leased. As the wires contract, they put the structure in a state of compression because 
the stress is transmitted to the concrete via the concrete-wire bond that is formed. 

Another technique, in which stresses are applied after the concrete hardens, is 
appropriately called posttensioning. Sheet metal or rubber tubes are situated inside 
and pass through the concrete forms, around which the concrete is cast. After the 
cement has hardened, steel wires are fed through the resulting holes, and tension 
is applied to the wires by means of jacks attached and abutted to the faces of the 
structure. Again, a compressive stress is imposed on the concrete piece, this time by 


634 * Chapter 16 / Composites 


the jacks. Finally, the empty spaces inside the tubing are filled with a grout to protect 
the wire from corrosion. 

Concrete that is prestressed should be of a high quality, with a low shrinkage 
and a low creep rate. Prestressed concretes, usually prefabricated, are commonly 
used for highway and railway bridges. 

16.3 DISPERSION-STRENGTHENED COMPOSITES 

Metals and metal alloys may be strengthened and hardened by the uniform disper¬ 
sion of several volume percent of fine particles of a very hard and inert material. The 
dispersed phase may be metallic or nonmetallic; oxide materials are often used. Again, 
the strengthening mechanism involves interactions between the particles and dislo¬ 
cations within the matrix, as with precipitation hardening. The dispersion strength¬ 
ening effect is not as pronounced as with precipitation hardening; however, the 
strengthening is retained at elevated temperatures and for extended time periods be¬ 
cause the dispersed particles are chosen to be unreactive with the matrix phase. For 
precipitation-hardened alloys, the increase in strength may disappear upon heat treat¬ 
ment as a consequence of precipitate growth or dissolution of the precipitate phase. 

The high-temperature strength of nickel alloys may be enhanced significantly 
by the addition of about 3 vol% of thoria (Th0 2 ) as finely dispersed particles; this 
material is known as thoria-dispersed (or TD) nickel. The same effect is produced 
in the aluminum-aluminum oxide system. A very thin and adherent alumina coat¬ 
ing is caused to form on the surface of extremely small (0.1 to 0.2 jxm thick) flakes 
of aluminum, which are dispersed within an aluminum metal matrix; this material 
is termed sintered aluminum powder (SAP).

Fiber-Reinforced Composites 

Technologically, the most important composites are those in which the dispersed phase 
is in the form of a fiber. Design goals of fiber-reinforced composites often include high 
strength and/or stiffness on a weight basis. These characteristics are expressed in terms 
of specific strength and specific modulus parameters, which correspond, respectively, 
to the ratios of tensile strength to specific gravity and modulus of elasticity to specific 
gravity. Fiber-reinforced composites with exceptionally high specific strengths and 
moduli have been produced that use low-density fiber and matrix materials. 

As noted in Figure 16.2, fiber-reinforced composites are subclassified by fiber 
length. For short fiber, the fibers are too short to produce a significant improve¬ 
ment in strength. 

16.4 INFLUENCE OF FIBER LENGTH 

The mechanical characteristics of a fiber-reinforced composite depend not only on 
the properties of the fiber, but also on the degree to which an applied load is trans¬ 
mitted to the fibers by the matrix phase. Important to the extent of this load trans¬ 
mittance is the magnitude of the interfacial bond between the fiber and matrix 
phases. Under an applied stress, this fiber-matrix bond ceases at the fiber ends,

yielding a matrix deformation pattern as shown schematically in Figure 16.6; in other 
words, there is no load transmittance from the matrix at each fiber extremity. 

Some critical fiber length is necessary for effective strengthening and stiffening of 
the composite material. This critical length l c is dependent on the fiber diameter d and 
its ultimate (or tensile) strength aj, and on the fiber-matrix bond strength (or the 
shear yield strength of the matrix, whichever is smaller) r c according to

For a number of glass and carbon fiber-matrix combinations, this critical length 
is on the order of 1 mm, which ranges between 20 and 150 times the fiber di¬ 
ameter. 

When a stress equal to aj is applied to a fiber having just this critical length, 
the stress-position profile shown in Figure 16.7a results; that is, the maximum fiber

load is achieved only at the axial center of the fiber. As fiber length / increases, the 
fiber reinforcement becomes more effective; this is demonstrated in Figure 16.1b, 
a stress-axial position profile for i>i c when the applied stress is equal to the fiber 
strength. Figure 16.7c shows the stress-position profile for / < l c . 

Fibers for which l l c (normally / > 15 l c ) are termed continuous; discontinu¬ 
ous or short fibers have lengths shorter than this. For discontinuous fibers of lengths 
significantly less than / c , the matrix deforms around the fiber such that there is 
virtually no stress transference and little reinforcement by the fiber. These are es¬ 
sentially the particulate composites as described earlier. To effect a significant 
improvement in strength of the composite, the fibers must be continuous. 


16.5 INFLUENCE OF FIBER ORIENTATION 
AND CONCENTRATION 

The arrangement or orientation of the fibers relative to one another, the fiber 
concentration, and the distribution all have a significant influence on the strength 
and other properties of fiber-reinforced composites. With respect to orientation, 
two extremes are possible: (1) a parallel alignment of the longitudinal axis of the 
fibers in a single direction, and (2) a totally random alignment. Continuous fibers 
are normally aligned (Figure 16.8a), whereas discontinuous fibers may be aligned 
(Figure 16.8Z?), randomly oriented (Figure 16.8c), or partially oriented. Better 
overall composite properties are realized when the fiber distribution is uniform. 

Continuous and Aligned Fiber Composites 

Tensile Stress-Strain Behavior—Longitudinal Loading 

Mechanical responses of this type of composite depend on several factors, in¬ 
cluding the stress-strain behaviors of fiber and matrix phases, the phase volume 
fractions, and the direction in which the stress or load is applied. Furthermore, 
the properties of a composite having its fibers aligned are highly anisotropic, that 
is, dependent on the direction in which they are measured. Let us first consider 
the stress-strain behavior for the situation wherein the stress is applied along

Figure 16.8a. 

To begin, assume the stress-versus-strain behaviors for fiber and matrix phases 
that are represented schematically in Figure 16.9a; in this treatment we consider the 
fiber to be totally brittle and the matrix phase to be reasonably ductile. Also indi¬ 
cated in this figure are fracture strengths in tension for fiber and matrix, crj , and 
cr*, respectively, and their corresponding fracture strains, ej, and ; furthermore, 
it is assumed that e* m > e^, which is normally the case. 

A fiber-reinforced composite consisting of these fiber and matrix materials will 
exhibit the uniaxial stress-strain response illustrated in Figure 16.9 b\ the fiber and 
matrix behaviors from Figure 16.9a are included to provide perspective. In the ini¬ 
tial Stage I region, both fibers and matrix deform elastically; normally this portion 
of the curve is linear. Typically, for a composite of this type, the matrix yields and 
deforms plastically (at e ym , Figure 16.9 b) while the fibers continue to stretch elasti¬ 
cally, inasmuch as the tensile strength of the fibers is significantly higher than the 
yield strength of the matrix. This process constitutes Stage II as noted in the figure; 
this stage is ordinarily very nearly linear, but of diminished slope relative to Stage I. 
Furthermore, in passing from Stage I to Stage II, the proportion of the applied load 
that is borne by the fibers increases. 

The onset of composite failure begins as the fibers start to fracture, which cor¬ 
responds to a strain of approximately as noted in Figure 16.9 b. Composite fail¬ 
ure is not catastrophic for a couple of reasons. First, not all fibers fracture at the 
same time, because there will always be considerable variations in the fracture 
strength of brittle fiber materials (Section 12.8). In addition, even after fiber failure, 
the matrix is still intact inasmuch as ej < e* (Figure 16.9a). Thus, these fractured 













638 * Chapter 16 / Composites 


fibers, which are shorter than the original ones, are still embedded within the intact 
matrix and consequently are capable of sustaining a diminished load as the matrix 
continues to plastically deform. 

Elastic Behavior—Longitudinal Loading 

Let us now consider the elastic behavior of a continuous and oriented fibrous com¬ 
posite that is loaded in the direction of fiber alignment. First, it is assumed that the 
fiber-matrix interfacial bond is very good, such that deformation of both matrix 
and fibers is the same (an isostrain situation). Under these conditions, the total load 
sustained by the composite F c is equal to the sum of the loads carried by the matrix 
phase F m and the fiber phase F f , or 

F c = F m + F f (16.4) 

From the definition of stress, Equation 6.1, F = crA ; and thus expressions for F c , F m , 
and Ff in terms of their respective stresses ( cr c , <x m , and erf) and cross-sectional areas 
(. A c , A m , and A f ) are possible. Substitution of these into Equation 16.4 yields 

a C A C cr m A m + (jfAf (16.5) 

and then, dividing through by the total cross-sectional area of the composite, A c , 
we have

(16.6) 


where AJA C and A f /A c are the area fractions of the matrix and fiber phases, re¬ 
spectively. If the composite, matrix, and fiber phase lengths are all equal, AJA C is 
equivalent to the volume fraction of the matrix, V m , and likewise for the fibers, V f 
= A f /A c . Equation 16.6 now becomes

Furthermore, if composite, matrix, and fiber deformations are all elastic, then 
erje c = E c , o-Je m = E m , and o- f /e f = E f , the Es being the moduli of elasticity for the 
respective phases. Substitution into Equation 16.9 yields an expression for the mod¬ 
ulus of elasticity of a continuous and aligned fibrous composite in the direction of 
alignment (or longitudinal direction ), E ch as 


E d = E m V m + EfV f (16.10a) 

or 

E cl = EJ1 - V f ) + E f V f (16.10b) 

because the composite consists of only matrix and fiber phases; that is, V m + V f = 1. 

Thus, E d is equal to the volume-fraction weighted average of the moduli of elas¬ 
ticity of the fiber and matrix phases. Other properties, including density, also have

tion 16.1, the upper bound for particle-reinforced composites. 

It can also be shown, for longitudinal loading, that the ratio of the load carried 
by the fibers to that carried by the matrix is

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 16.1 

Property Determinations for a Glass Fiber-Reinforced 
Composite—Longitudinal Direction 

A continuous and aligned glass fiber-reinforced composite consists of 40 vol% 
of glass fibers having a modulus of elasticity of 69 GPa (10 X 10 6 psi) and 
60 vol% of a polyester resin that, when hardened, displays a modulus of 
3.4 GPa (0.5 X 10 6 psi). 

(a) Compute the modulus of elasticity of this composite in the longitudinal 
direction. 

(b) If the cross-sectional area is 250 mm 2 (0.4 in. 2 ) and a stress of 50 MPa 
(7250 psi) is applied in this longitudinal direction, compute the magnitude of 
the load carried by each of the fiber and matrix phases. 

(c) Determine the strain that is sustained by each phase when the stress in 
part (b) is applied. 

Solution 

(a) The modulus of elasticity of the composite is calculated using Equation 
16.10a: 


E cl = (3.4 GPa)(0.6) + (69 GPa)(0.4) 

= 30 GPa (4.3 X 10 6 psi) 

(b) To solve this portion of the problem, first find the ratio of fiber load to 
matrix load, using Equation 16.11; thus, 

F f _ (69 GPa)(0.4) 

F m (3.4 GPa)(0.6) 

or Ff = 13.5 F m . 

In addition, the total force sustained by the composite F c may be com¬ 
puted from the applied stress cr and total composite cross-sectional area A c 
according to 

F c = A c a = (250 mm 2 )(50 MPa) = 12,500 N (2900 lb f ) 

However, this total load is just the sum of the loads carried by fiber and matrix 
phases; that is, 


F c = F f + F m = 12,500 N (2900 lb f ) 






640 * Chapter 16 / Composites 


transverse direction 


Substitution for F f from the preceding equation yields 
13.5 F m + F m = 12,500 N 


or 


F m = 860 N (200 lb f ) 

whereas 

F f = F c - F m = 12,500 N - 860 N = 11,640 N (2700 lb f ) 

Thus, the fiber phase supports the vast majority of the applied load. 

(c) The stress for both fiber and matrix phases must first be calculated. Then, 
by using the elastic modulus for each [from part (a)], the strain values may be 
determined. 

For stress calculations, phase cross-sectional areas are necessary: 

A m = V m A c = (0.6)(250 mm 2 ) = 150 mm 2 (0.24 in. 2 ) 

and 

A f = V f A c = (0.4)(250 mm 2 ) = 100 mm 2 (0.16 in. 2 ) 

Thus, 


F m 860 N cr701v/rT1 /000 

cr m = — = — - 2 = 5/73 MPa ( 833 P S1 ) 

A m 150 mm 

Ff 11,640 N 

Vf = ~r = W-7 = 116 - 4 MPa ( 16 ’ 875 P si ) 

A f 100 mm 

Finally, strains are computed as 




cr m _ 5.73 MPa 

E m ~ 3.4 X 10 3 MPa 
<*f 116.4 MPa 


= 1.69 X 10

69 X 10 3 MPa 


= 1.69 X 10

Therefore, strains for both matrix and fiber phases are identical, which 
they should be, according to Equation 16.8 in the previous development. 


Elastic Behavior—Transverse Loading 

A continuous and oriented fiber composite may be loaded in the transverse direction; 
that is, the load is applied at a 90° angle to the direction of fiber alignment as shown 
in Figure 16.8a. For this situation the stress cr to which the composite as well as both 
phases are exposed is the same, or 

<T C = Cm = °f = O' (16.12) 

This is termed an isostress state. Also, the strain or deformation of the entire com¬ 
posite e c is 

e c = e m V m + e f V f (16.13)

Equation 16.16 is analogous to the lower-bound expression for particulate com¬ 
posites, Equation 16.2. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 16.2 

Elastic Modulus Determination for a Glass 
Fiber-Reinforced Composite—Transverse Direction 

Compute the elastic modulus of the composite material described in Exam¬ 
ple Problem 16.1, but assume that the stress is applied perpendicular to the 
direction of fiber alignment. 

Solution 

According to Equation 16.16, 

(3.4 GPa)(69 GPa) 

Ect ~ (0.6)(69 GPa) + (0.4)(3.4 GPa) 

= 5.5 GPa (0.81 X 10 6 psi) 

This value for E ct is slightly greater than that of the matrix phase but, from 
Example Problem 16.1a, only approximately one-fifth of the modulus of elas¬ 
ticity along the fiber direction (E cl ), which indicates the degree of anisotropy 
of continuous and oriented fiber composites. 


Longitudinal Tensile Strength 

We now consider the strength characteristics of continuous and aligned fiber- 
reinforced composites that are loaded in the longitudinal direction. Under these 
circumstances, strength is normally taken as the maximum stress on the 
stress-strain curve, Figure 16.9often this point corresponds to fiber fracture, 
and marks the onset of composite failure. Table 16.1 lists typical longitudinal

tensile strength values for three common fibrous composites. Failure of this type 
of composite material is a relatively complex process, and several different fail¬ 
ure modes are possible. The mode that operates for a specific composite will depend 
on fiber and matrix properties, and the nature and strength of the fiber-matrix 
interfacial bond. 

If we assume that ej < e* m (Figure 16.9a), which is the usual case, then fibers 
will fail before the matrix. Once the fibers have fractured, most of the load that 
was borne by the fibers is now transferred to the matrix. This being the case, it 
is possible to adapt the expression for the stress on this type of composite, Equa¬ 
tion 16.7, into the following expression for the longitudinal strength of the com¬ 
posite, a%\ 


of/ = + aJV f 


(16.17) 


Here cr' m is the stress in the matrix at fiber failure (as illustrated in Figure 16.9a) 
and, as previously, crj is the fiber tensile strength. 


Transverse Tensile Strength 

The strengths of continuous and unidirectional fibrous composites are highly 
anisotropic, and such composites are normally designed to be loaded along the high- 
strength, longitudinal direction. However, during in-service applications transverse 
tensile loads may also be present. Under these circumstances, premature failure may 
result inasmuch as transverse strength is usually extremely low—it sometimes lies 
below the tensile strength of the matrix. Thus, the reinforcing effect of the fibers is 
negative. Typical transverse tensile strengths for three unidirectional composites are 
contained in Table 16.1. 

Whereas longitudinal strength is dominated by fiber strength, a variety of 
factors will have a significant influence on the transverse strength; these factors 
include properties of both the fiber and matrix, the fiber-matrix bond strength, 
and the presence of voids. Measures that have been employed to improve the 
transverse strength of these composites usually involve modifying properties of 
the matrix.

Discontinuous and Aligned-Fiber Composites 

Even though reinforcement efficiency is lower for discontinuous than for continu¬ 
ous fibers, discontinuous and aligned-fiber composites (Figure 16.8Z?) are becoming 
increasingly more important in the commercial market. Chopped-glass fibers are 
used most extensively; however, carbon and aramid discontinuous fibers are also 
employed. These short-fiber composites can be produced having moduli of elas¬ 
ticity and tensile strengths that approach 90% and 50%, respectively, of their 
continuous-fiber counterparts. 

For a discontinuous and aligned-fiber composite having a uniform distribution of 
fibers and in which / > / c , the longitudinal strength (cr* d ) is given by the relationship 

< d = o-JVf (ll |) + <4(1 I V f ) (16.18) 

where erf and cr' m represent, respectively, the fracture strength of the fiber and the 
stress in the matrix when the composite fails (Figure 16.9a). 

If the fiber length is less than critical (/ < / c ), then the longitudinal strength 
(a/d) is given by 


<r2r = l J V f + ~ V f) (16.19) 

where d is the fiber diameter and t c is the smaller of either the fiber-matrix bond 
strength or the matrix shear yield strength.

ilar to Equation 16.10a may be used, as follows:

In this expression, K is a fiber efficiency parameter that depends on V f and the 
Ef/E m ratio. Of course, its magnitude will be less than unity, usually in the range 0.1 
to 0.6. Thus, for random fiber reinforcement (as with oriented), the modulus in¬ 
creases in some proportion of the volume fraction of fiber. Table 16.2, which gives 
some of the mechanical properties of unreinforced and reinforced polycarbonates 
for discontinuous and randomly oriented glass fibers, provides an idea of the mag¬ 
nitude of the reinforcement that is possible. 

By way of summary, then, aligned fibrous composites are inherently anisotropic 
in that the maximum strength and reinforcement are achieved along the alignment 
(longitudinal) direction. In the transverse direction, fiber reinforcement is virtually 
nonexistent: fracture usually occurs at relatively low tensile stresses. For other stress 
orientations, composite strength lies between these extremes. The efficiency of fiber 
reinforcement for several situations is presented in Table 16.3; this efficiency is taken 
to be unity for an oriented-fiber composite in the alignment direction, and zero 
perpendicular to it. 

When multidirectional stresses are imposed within a single plane, aligned lay¬ 
ers that are fastened together one on top of another at different orientations are 
frequently used. These are termed laminar composites, which are discussed in 
Section 16.14.

16.6 The Fiber Phase • 645 


Applications involving totally multidirectional applied stresses normally use dis¬ 
continuous fibers, which are randomly oriented in the matrix material. Table 16.3 
shows that the reinforcement efficiency is only one-fifth that of an aligned com¬ 
posite in the longitudinal direction; however, the mechanical characteristics are 
isotropic. 

Consideration of orientation and fiber length for a particular composite will 
depend on the level and nature of the applied stress as well as fabrication cost. 
Production rates for short-fiber composites (both aligned and randomly oriented) 
are rapid, and intricate shapes can be formed that are not possible with continuous 
fiber reinforcement. Furthermore, fabrication costs are considerably lower than for 
continuous and aligned; fabrication techniques applied to short-fiber composite ma¬ 
terials include compression, injection, and extrusion molding, which are described 
for unreinforced polymers in Section 15.22.

16.6 THE FIBER PHASE 

An important characteristic of most materials, especially brittle ones, is that a small- 
diameter fiber is much stronger than the bulk material. As discussed in Section 12.8, 
the probability of the presence of a critical surface flaw that can lead to fracture 
diminishes with decreasing specimen volume, and this feature is used to advantage 
in the fiber-reinforced composites. Also, the materials used for reinforcing fibers 
have high tensile strengths. 

On the basis of diameter and character, fibers are grouped into three dif- 
whisker ferent classifications: whiskers , fibers, and wires. Whiskers are very thin single 

crystals that have extremely large length-to-diameter ratios. As a consequence 
of their small size, they have a high degree of crystalline perfection and are vir¬ 
tually flaw-free, which accounts for their exceptionally high strengths; they are 
among the strongest known materials. In spite of these high strengths, whiskers 
are not used extensively as a reinforcement medium because they are extremely 
expensive. Moreover, it is difficult and often impractical to incorporate whiskers 
into a matrix. Whisker materials include graphite, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, 
and aluminum oxide; some mechanical characteristics of these materials are given 
in Table 16.4. 

fiber Materials that are classified as fibers are either polycrystalline or amorphous 

and have small diameters; fibrous materials are generally either polymers or ce¬ 
ramics (e.g., the polymer aramids, glass, carbon, boron, aluminum oxide, and silicon 
carbide). Table 16.4 also presents some data on a few materials that are used in 
fiber form. 

Fine wires have relatively large diameters; typical materials include steel, 
molybdenum, and tungsten. Wires are used as a radial steel reinforcement in au¬ 
tomobile tires, in filament-wound rocket casings, and in wire-wound high-pressure 
hoses.

16.7 THE MATRIX PHASE 

The matrix phase of fibrous composites may be a metal, polymer, or ceramic. In 
general, metals and polymers are used as matrix materials because some ductility 
is desirable; for ceramic-matrix composites (Section 16.10), the reinforcing compo¬ 
nent is added to improve fracture toughness. The discussion of this section will fo¬ 
cus on polymer and metal matrices. 

For fiber-reinforced composites, the matrix phase serves several functions. First, 
it binds the fibers together and acts as the medium by which an externally applied 
stress is transmitted and distributed to the fibers; only a very small proportion of 
an applied load is sustained by the matrix phase. Furthermore, the matrix material 
should be ductile. In addition, the elastic modulus of the fiber should be much higher 
than that of the matrix. The second function of the matrix is to protect the indi¬ 
vidual fibers from surface damage as a result of mechanical abrasion or chemical 





16.8 Polymer-Matrix Composites * 647 

reactions with the environment. Such interactions may introduce surface flaws 
capable of forming cracks, which may lead to failure at low tensile stress levels. Finally, 
the matrix separates the fibers and, by virtue of its relative softness and plasticity, 
prevents the propagation of brittle cracks from fiber to fiber, which could result in 
catastrophic failure; in other words, the matrix phase serves as a barrier to crack 
propagation. Even though some of the individual fibers fail, total composite frac¬ 
ture will not occur until large numbers of adjacent fibers, once having failed, form 
a cluster of critical size. 

It is essential that adhesive bonding forces between fiber and matrix be high 
to minimize fiber pullout. In fact, bonding strength is an important consideration 
in the choice of the matrix-fiber combination. The ultimate strength of the com¬ 
posite depends to a large degree on the magnitude of this bond; adequate bonding 
is essential to maximize the stress transmittance from the weak matrix to the strong 
fibers. 

16.8 POLYMER-MATRIX COMPOSITES 

polymer-matrix Polymer-matrix composites ( PMCs ) consist of a polymer resin 2 as the matrix, with 

composite fibers as the reinforcement medium. These materials are used in the greatest di¬ 

versity of composite applications, as well as in the largest quantities, in light of their 
room-temperature properties, ease of fabrication, and cost. In this section the var¬ 
ious classifications of PMCs are discussed according to reinforcement type (i.e., 
glass, carbon, and aramid), along with their applications and the various polymer 
resins that are employed. 

Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) Composites 

Fiberglass is simply a composite consisting of glass fibers, either continuous or 
discontinuous, contained within a polymer matrix; this type of composite is pro¬ 
duced in the largest quantities. The composition of the glass that is most commonly 
drawn into fibers (sometimes referred to as E-glass) is contained in Table 13.1; fiber 
diameters normally range between 3 and 20 fxm. Glass is popular as a fiber rein¬ 
forcement material for several reasons: 

1. It is easily drawn into high-strength fibers from the molten state. 

2. It is readily available and may be fabricated into a glass-reinforced plastic 
economically using a wide variety of composite-manufacturing techniques. 

3. As a fiber it is relatively strong, and when embedded in a plastic matrix, it 
produces a composite having a very high specific strength. 

4. When coupled with the various plastics, it possesses a chemical inertness that 
renders the composite useful in a variety of corrosive environments. 

The surface characteristics of glass fibers are extremely important because 
even minute surface flaws can deleteriously affect the tensile properties, as dis¬ 
cussed in Section 12.8. Surface flaws are easily introduced by rubbing or abrad¬ 
ing the surface with another hard material. Also, glass surfaces that have been ex¬ 
posed to the normal atmosphere for even short time periods generally have a 
weakened surface layer that interferes with bonding to the matrix. Newly drawn 
fibers are normally coated during drawing with a size , a thin layer of a substance 


2 The term resin is used in this context to denote a high-molecular-weight reinforcing 
plastic.

that protects the fiber surface from damage and undesirable environmental in¬ 
teractions. This size is ordinarily removed prior to composite fabrication and re¬ 
placed with a coupling agent or finish that produces a chemical bond between the 
fiber and matrix. 

There are several limitations to this group of materials. In spite of having 
high strengths, they are not very stiff and do not display the rigidity that is nec¬ 
essary for some applications (e.g., as structural members for airplanes and 
bridges). Most fiberglass materials are limited to service temperatures below 
200°C (400°F); at higher temperatures, most polymers begin to flow or to dete¬ 
riorate. Service temperatures may be extended to approximately 300°C (575°F) 
by using high-purity fused silica for the fibers and high-temperature polymers 
such as the polyimide resins. 

Many fiberglass applications are familiar: automotive and marine bodies, plas¬ 
tic pipes, storage containers, and industrial floorings. The transportation industries 
are using increasing amounts of glass fiber-reinforced plastics in an effort to de¬ 
crease vehicle weight and boost fuel efficiencies. A host of new applications are be¬ 
ing used or currently investigated by the automotive industry. 

Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Composites 

Carbon is a high-performance fiber material that is the most commonly used rein¬ 
forcement in advanced (i.e., nonfiberglass) polymer-matrix composites. The reasons 
for this are as follows: 

1. Carbon fibers have the highest specific modulus and specific strength of all 
reinforcing fiber materials. 

2 . They retain their high tensile modulus and high strength at elevated tempera¬ 
tures; high-temperature oxidation, however, may be a problem. 

3 . At room temperature, carbon fibers are not affected by moisture or a wide 
variety of solvents, acids, and bases. 

4 . These fibers exhibit a diversity of physical and mechanical characteristics, 
allowing composites incorporating these fibers to have specific engineered 
properties. 

5 . Fiber and composite manufacturing processes have been developed that are 
relatively inexpensive and cost effective. 

Use of the term carbon fiber may seem perplexing because carbon is an ele¬ 
ment, and, as noted in Section 12.4, the stable form of crystalline carbon at ambi¬ 
ent conditions is graphite, having the structure represented in Figure 12.17. Carbon 
fibers are not totally crystalline, but are composed of both graphitic and noncrys- 
talline regions; these areas of noncrystallinity are devoid of the three-dimensional 
ordered arrangement of hexagonal carbon networks that is characteristic of graphite 
(Figure 12.17). 

Manufacturing techniques for producing carbon fibers are relatively complex 
and will not be discussed. However, three different organic precursor materials are 
used: rayon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and pitch. Processing technique will vary from 
precursor to precursor, as will also the resultant fiber characteristics. 

One classification scheme for carbon fibers is by tensile modulus; on this basis 
the four classes are standard, intermediate, high, and ultrahigh moduli. Further¬ 
more, fiber diameters normally range between 4 and 10 pan; both continuous and 
chopped forms are available. In addition, carbon fibers are normally coated with 
a protective epoxy size that also improves adhesion with the polymer matrix. 


16.8 Polymer-Matrix Composites • 649 


Carbon-reinforced polymer composites are currently being used extensively in 
sports and recreational equipment (fishing rods, golf clubs), filament-wound rocket 
motor cases, pressure vessels, and aircraft structural components—both military and 
commercial, fixed-wing and helicopters (e.g., as wing, body, stabilizer, and rudder 
components). 

Aramid Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites 

Aramid fibers are high-strength, high-modulus materials that were introduced in the 
early 1970s. They are especially desirable for their outstanding strength-to-weight ra¬ 
tios, which are superior to those of metals. Chemically, this group of materials is known 
as poly(paraphenylene terephthalamide). There are a number of aramid materials; 
trade names for two of the most common are Kevlar and Nomex. For the former, 
there are several grades (Kevlar 29, 49, and 149) that have different mechanical be¬ 
haviors. During synthesis, the rigid molecules are aligned in the direction of the fiber 
axis, as liquid crystal domains (Section 15.19); the repeat unit and the mode of chain 
alignment are represented in Figure 16.10. Mechanically, these fibers have longitudi¬ 
nal tensile strengths and tensile moduli (Table 16.4) that are higher than other poly¬ 
meric fiber materials; however, they are relatively weak in compression. In addition, 
this material is known for its toughness, impact resistance, and resistance to creep and 
fatigue failure. Even though the aramids are thermoplastics, they are, nevertheless, 
resistant to combustion and stable to relatively high temperatures; the temperature 
range over which they retain their high mechanical properties is between —200 and 
200°C (-330 and 390°F). Chemically, they are susceptible to degradation by strong 
acids and bases, but they are relatively inert in other solvents and chemicals. 

The aramid fibers are most often used in composites having polymer matrices; 
common matrix materials are the epoxies and polyesters. Because the fibers are rel¬ 
atively flexible and somewhat ductile, they may be processed by most common 
textile operations. Typical applications of these aramid composites are in ballistic 
products (bulletproof vests and armor), sporting goods, tires, ropes, missile cases, 
and pressure vessels and as a replacement for asbestos in automotive brake and 
clutch linings and gaskets. 

The properties of continuous and aligned glass, carbon, and aramid fiber-reinforced 
epoxy composites are included in Table 16.5. Thus, a comparison of the mechanical 
characteristics of these three materials may be made in both longitudinal and trans¬ 
verse directions.

Other Fiber Reinforcement Materials 

Glass, carbon, and the aramids are the most common fiber reinforcements incor¬ 
porated in polymer matrices. Other fiber materials that are used to much lesser de¬ 
grees are boron, silicon carbide, and aluminum oxide; tensile moduli, tensile 
strengths, specific strengths, and specific moduli of these materials in fiber form are 
contained in Table 16.4. Boron fiber-reinforced polymer composites have been used 
in military aircraft components, helicopter rotor blades, and some sporting goods. 
Silicon carbide and aluminum oxide fibers are used in tennis rackets, circuit boards, 
military armor, and rocket nose cones. 

Polymer-Matrix Materials 

The roles assumed by the polymer matrix are outlined in Section 16.7. In addi¬ 
tion, the matrix often determines the maximum service temperature, because it 
normally softens, melts, or degrades at a much lower temperature than the fiber 
reinforcement. 

The most widely used and least expensive polymer resins are the polyesters and 
vinyl esters; 3 these matrix materials are used primarily for glass fiber-reinforced 
composites. A large number of resin formulations provide a wide range of proper¬ 
ties for these polymers. The epoxies are more expensive and, in addition to com¬ 
mercial applications, are also used extensively in PMCs for aerospace applications; 
they have better mechanical properties and resistance to moisture than the poly¬ 
esters and vinyl resins. For high-temperature applications, polyimide resins are em¬ 
ployed; their continuous-use, upper-temperature limit is approximately 230°C 
(450°F). Finally, high-temperature thermoplastic resins offer the potential to be used 
in future aerospace applications; such materials include polyetheretherketone 
(PEEK), poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), and polyetherimide (PEI).

section are included in Appendices B, D, and E.

DESIGN EXAMPLE 16.1 


Design of a Tubular Composite Shaft 


A tubular composite shaft is to be designed that has an outside diameter of 
70 mm (2.75 in.), an inside diameter of 50 mm (1.97 in.), and a length of 1.0 m 
(39.4 in.); such is represented schematically in Figure 16.11. The mechanical char¬ 
acteristic of prime importance is bending stiffness in terms of the longitudinal 
modulus of elasticity; strength and fatigue resistance are not significant param¬ 
eters for this application when filament composites are used. Stiffness is to be 
specified as maximum allowable deflection in bending; when subjected to three- 
point bending as in Figure 12.32 (i.e., support points at both tube extremities and 
load application at the longitudinal midpoint), a load of 1000 N (225 lb f ) is to 
produce an elastic deflection of no more than 0.35 mm (0.014 in.) at the mid¬ 
point position. 

Continuous fibers that are oriented parallel to the tube axis will be used; 
possible fiber materials are glass, and carbon in standard-, intermediate-, and 
high-modulus grades. The matrix material is to be an epoxy resin, and the max¬ 
imum allowable fiber volume fraction is 0.60. 

This design problem calls for us to do the following: 


(a) Decide which of the four fiber materials, when embedded in the epoxy matrix, 
meet the stipulated criteria. 

(b) Of these possibilities, select the one fiber material that will yield the low¬ 
est-cost composite material (assuming fabrication costs are the same for all 
fibers). 


Elastic modulus, density, and cost data for the fiber and matrix materials are 
contained in Table 16.6. 


Solution 

(a) It first becomes necessary to determine the required longitudinal modu¬ 
lus of elasticity for this composite material, consistent with the stipulated 
criteria. This computation necessitates the use of the three-point deflection 
expression

= 69.3 GPa (9.9 X 10 6 psi) 

The next step is to determine the fiber and matrix volume fractions for each 
of the four candidate fiber materials. This is possible using the rule-of-mixtures 
expression, Equation 16.10b: 

E cs = E m V m + EfV f = E m ( 1 - V» + EfV f 

Table 16.7 lists the V m and V}values required for E cs = 69.3 GPa; Equation 16.10b 
and the moduli data in Table 16.6 were used in these computations. Only the 
three carbon-fiber types are possible candidates because their V f values are less 
than 0.6. 

(b) At this point it becomes necessary to determine the volume of fibers 
and matrix for each of the three carbon types. The total tube volume V c in

Thus, fiber and matrix volumes result from products of this value and the V f and

which are then converted into masses using densities (Table 16.6), and finally 
into material costs, from the per unit mass cost (also given in Table 16.6). 

As may be noted in Table 16.8, the material of choice (i.e., the least expen¬ 
sive) is the standard-modulus carbon-fiber composite; the relatively low cost per 
unit mass of this fiber material offsets its relatively low modulus of elasticity and 
required high volume fraction.

MATRIX COMPOSITES 

As the name implies, for metal-matrix composites ( MMCs ) the matrix is a ductile 
metal. These materials may be used at higher service temperatures than their base- 
metal counterparts; furthermore, the reinforcement may improve specific stiffness,

specific strength, abrasion resistance, creep resistance, thermal conductivity, and 
dimensional stability. Some of the advantages of these materials over the polymer- 
matrix composites include higher operating temperatures, nonflammability, and 
greater resistance to degradation by organic fluids. Metal-matrix composites are 
much more expensive than PMCs, and, therefore, MMC use is somewhat restricted. 

The superalloys, as well as alloys of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and cop¬ 
per, are employed as matrix materials. The reinforcement may be in the form of 
particulates, both continuous and discontinuous fibers, and whiskers; concentrations 
normally range between 10 and 60 vol%. Continuous-fiber materials include car¬ 
bon, silicon carbide, boron, aluminum oxide, and the refractory metals. On the other 
hand, discontinuous reinforcements consist primarily of silicon carbide whiskers, 
chopped fibers of aluminum oxide and carbon, and particulates of silicon carbide 
and aluminum oxide. In a sense, the cermets (Section 16.2) fall within this MMC 
scheme. Table 16.9 presents the properties of several common metal-matrix, con¬ 
tinuous and aligned fiber-reinforced composites. 

Some matrix-reinforcement combinations are highly reactive at elevated tem¬ 
peratures. Consequently, composite degradation may be caused by high-temperature 
processing or by subjecting the MMC to elevated temperatures during service. This 
problem is commonly resolved either by applying a protective surface coating to 
the reinforcement or by modifying the matrix alloy composition. 

Normally the processing of MMCs involves at least two steps: consolidation or 
synthesis (i.e., introduction of reinforcement into the matrix), followed by a shap¬ 
ing operation. A host of consolidation techniques are available, some of which are 
relatively sophisticated; discontinuous fiber MMCs are amenable to shaping by stan¬ 
dard metal-forming operations (e.g., forging, extrusion, rolling). 

Automobile manufacturers have recently begun to use MMCs in their prod¬ 
ucts. For example, some engine components have been introduced consisting of an 
aluminum-alloy matrix that is reinforced with aluminum oxide and carbon fibers; 
this MMC is light in weight and resists wear and thermal distortion. Metal-matrix 
composites are also employed in driveshafts (that have higher rotational speeds and 
reduced vibrational noise levels), extruded stabilizer bars, and forged suspension 
and transmission components. 

The aerospace industry also uses MMCs. Structural applications include ad¬ 
vanced aluminum-alloy metal-matrix composites; boron fibers are used as the re¬ 
inforcement for the space shuttle orbiter, and continuous graphite fibers for the 
Hubble Space Telescope.

16.10 Ceramic-Matrix Composites * 655 


The high-temperature creep and rupture properties of some of the superalloys 
(Ni- and Co-based alloys) may be enhanced by fiber reinforcement using refrac¬ 
tory metals such as tungsten. Excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance and 
impact strength are also maintained. Designs incorporating these composites per¬ 
mit higher operating temperatures and better efficiencies for turbine engines. 

16.10 CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES 

As discussed in Chapters 12 and 13, ceramic materials are inherently resilient to 
oxidation and deterioration at elevated temperatures; were it not for their disposi¬ 
tion to brittle fracture, some of these materials would be ideal candidates for use 
in high-temperature and severe-stress applications, specifically for components in 
automobile and aircraft gas turbine engines. Fracture toughness values for ceramic 
materials are low and typically lie between 1 and 5 MPa Vrn (0.9 and 4.5 ksiVim); 
see Table 8.1 and Table B.5 in Appendix B. By way of contrast, K Ic values for most 
metals are much higher [15 to greater than 150 MPa Vrn (14 to > 140 ksiVim)]. 

The fracture toughnesses of ceramics have been improved significantly by the 
ceramic-matrix development of a new generation of ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs)—particu- 

composite lates, fibers, or whiskers of one ceramic material that have been embedded into a 

matrix of another ceramic. Ceramic-matrix composite materials have extended frac¬ 
ture toughnesses to between about 6 and 20 MPaVm (5.5 and 18 ksiVim). 

In essence, this improvement in the fracture properties results from interactions 
between advancing cracks and dispersed phase particles. Crack initiation normally 
occurs with the matrix phase, whereas crack propagation is impeded or hindered 
by the particles, fibers, or whiskers. Several techniques are used to retard crack prop¬ 
agation, which are discussed as follows. 

One particularly interesting and promising toughening technique employs a 
phase transformation to arrest the propagation of cracks and is aptly termed trans¬ 
formation toughening. Small particles of partially stabilized zirconia (Section 12.7) 
are dispersed within the matrix material, often A1 2 0 3 or Zr0 2 itself. Typically, CaO, 
MgO, Y 2 0 3 , and CeO are used as stabilizers. Partial stabilization allows retention 
of the metastable tetragonal phase at ambient conditions rather than the stable 
monoclinic phase; these two phases are noted on the Zr0 2 -CaZr0 3 phase diagram 
in Figure 12.26. The stress field in front of a propagating crack causes these 
metastably retained tetragonal particles to undergo transformation to the stable 
monoclinic phase. Accompanying this transformation is a slight particle volume in¬ 
crease, and the net result is that compressive stresses are established on the crack 
surfaces near the crack tip that tend to pinch the crack shut, thereby arresting its 
growth. This process is demonstrated schematically in Figure 16.12. 

Other recently developed toughening techniques involve the use of ceramic 
whiskers, often SiC or Si 3 N 4 . These whiskers may inhibit crack propagation by (1) 
deflecting crack tips, (2) forming bridges across crack faces, (3) absorbing energy 
during pullout as the whiskers debond from the matrix, and/or (4) causing a redis¬ 
tribution of stresses in regions adjacent to the crack tips. 

In general, increasing fiber content improves strength and fracture toughness; 
this is demonstrated in Table 16.10 for SiC whisker-reinforced alumina. Further¬ 
more, there is a considerable reduction in the scatter of fracture strengths for 
whisker-reinforced ceramics relative to their unreinforced counterparts. In addition, 
these CMCs exhibit improved high-temperature creep behavior and resistance to 
thermal shock (i.e., failure resulting from sudden changes in temperature). 

Ceramic-matrix composites may be fabricated using hot pressing, hot isostatic 
pressing, and liquid-phase sintering techniques. Relative to applications, SiC

whisker-reinforced aluminas are being used as cutting-tool inserts for machining 
hard metal alloys; tool lives for these materials are greater than for cemented car¬ 
bides (Section 16.2). 

16.11 CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES 

One of the most advanced and promising engineering materials is the carbon 
carbon-carbon fiber-reinforced carbon-matrix composite, often termed a carbon-carbon compos- 

composite ite; as the name implies, both reinforcement and matrix are carbon. These materials 

are relatively new and expensive and, therefore, are not currently being used ex¬ 
tensively. Their desirable properties include high-tensile moduli and tensile strengths 
that are retained to temperatures in excess of 2000°C (3630°F), resistance to creep, 
and relatively large fracture toughness values. Furthermore, carbon-carbon com¬ 
posites have low coefficients of thermal expansion and relatively high thermal con¬ 
ductivities; these characteristics, coupled with high strengths, give rise to a relatively 
low susceptibility to thermal shock. Their major drawback is a propensity to high- 
temperature oxidation. 

The carbon-carbon composites are employed in rocket motors, as friction ma¬ 
terials in aircraft and high-performance automobiles, for hot-pressing molds, in com¬ 
ponents for advanced turbine engines, and as ablative shields for re-entry vehicles.

16.13 Processing of Fiber-Reinforced Composites * 657 


The primary reason that these composite materials are so expensive is the 
relatively complex processing techniques that are employed. Preliminary procedures 
are similar to those used for carbon-fiber, polymer-matrix composites. That is, the 
continuous carbon fibers are laid down having the desired two- or three-dimensional 
pattern; these fibers are then impregnated with a liquid polymer resin, often a phe¬ 
nolic; the workpiece is next formed into the final shape, and the resin is allowed to 
cure. At this time the matrix resin is pyrolyzed, that is, converted into carbon by 
heating in an inert atmosphere; during pyrolysis, molecular components consisting 
of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are driven off, leaving behind large carbon-chain 
molecules. Subsequent heat treatments at higher temperatures will cause this carbon 
matrix to density and increase in strength. The resulting composite, then, consists 
of the original carbon fibers that remained essentially unaltered, which are con¬ 
tained in this pyrolyzed carbon matrix. 

16.12 HYBRID COMPOSITES 

hybrid composite A relatively new fiber-reinforced composite is the hybrid, which is obtained by us¬ 
ing two or more different kinds of fibers in a single matrix; hybrids have a better 
all-around combination of properties than composites containing only a single fiber 
type. A variety of fiber combinations and matrix materials are used, but in the most 
common system, both carbon and glass fibers are incorporated into a polymeric 
resin. The carbon fibers are strong and relatively stiff and provide a low-density re¬ 
inforcement; however, they are expensive. Glass fibers are inexpensive and lack the 
stiffness of carbon. The glass-carbon hybrid is stronger and tougher, has a higher 
impact resistance, and may be produced at a lower cost than either of the compa¬ 
rable all-carbon or all-glass reinforced plastics. 

The two different fibers may be combined in a number of ways, which will 
ultimately affect the overall properties. For example, the fibers may all be aligned 
and intimately mixed with one another, or laminations may be constructed con¬ 
sisting of layers, each of which consists of a single fiber type, alternating one with 
another. In virtually all hybrids the properties are anisotropic. 

When hybrid composites are stressed in tension, failure is usually noncata- 
strophic (i.e., does not occur suddenly). The carbon fibers are the first to fail, at 
which time the load is transferred to the glass fibers. Upon failure of the glass fibers, 
the matrix phase must sustain the applied load. Eventual composite failure concurs 
with that of the matrix phase. 

Principal applications for hybrid composites are lightweight land, water, and 
air transport structural components, sporting goods, and lightweight orthopedic 
components. 

16.13 PROCESSING OF FIBER-REINFORCED 
COMPOSITES 

To fabricate continuous fiber-reinforced plastics that meet design specifications, the 
fibers should be uniformly distributed within the plastic matrix and, in most in¬ 
stances, all oriented in virtually the same direction. In this section several techniques 
(pultrusion, filament winding, and prepreg production processes) by which useful 
products of these materials are manufactured will be discussed. 

Pultrusion 

Pultrusion is used for the manufacture of components having continuous lengths 
and a constant cross-sectional shape (rods, tubes, beams, etc.). With this technique,

illustrated schematically in Figure 16.13, continuous-fiber rovings, or tows, 4 are first 
impregnated with a thermosetting resin; these are then pulled through a steel die 
that preforms to the desired shape and also establishes the resin/fiber ratio. The 
stock then passes through a curing die that is precision machined so as to impart 
the final shape; this die is also heated to initiate curing of the resin matrix. A pulling 
device draws the stock through the dies and also determines the production speed. 
Tubes and hollow sections are made possible by using center mandrels or inserted 
hollow cores. Principal reinforcements are glass, carbon, and aramid fibers, normally 
added in concentrations between 40 and 70 vol%. Commonly used matrix materi¬ 
als include polyesters, vinyl esters, and epoxy resins. 

Pultrusion is a continuous process that is easily automated; production rates are 
relatively high, making it very cost effective. Furthermore, a wide variety of shapes 
are possible, and there is really no practical limit to the length of stock that may be 
manufactured. 

Prepreg Production Processes 

prepreg Prepreg is the composite industry’s term for continuous-fiber reinforcement preim¬ 

pregnated with a polymer resin that is only partially cured. This material is deliv¬ 
ered in tape form to the manufacturer, which then directly molds and fully cures 
the product without having to add any resin. It is probably the composite material 
form most widely used for structural applications. 

The prepregging process, represented schematically for thermoset polymers in 
Figure 16.14, begins by collimating a series of spool-wound continuous-fiber tows. 
These tows are then sandwiched and pressed between sheets of release and carrier 
paper using heated rollers, a process termed calendering. The release paper sheet has 
been coated with a thin film of heated resin solution of relatively low viscosity so as 
to provide for its thorough impregnation of the fibers. A doctor blade spreads the 
resin into a film of uniform thickness and width. The final prepreg product—the thin 
tape consisting of continuous and aligned fibers embedded in a partially cured resin— 
is prepared for packaging by winding onto a cardboard core. As shown in Figure 16.14, 
the release paper sheet is removed as the impregnated tape is spooled. Typical tape 
thicknesses range between 0.08 and 0.25 mm (3 X 10 -3 and 10 -2 in.) and tape widths 
range between 25 and 1525 mm (1 and 60 in.), whereas resin content usually lies be¬ 
tween about 35 and 45 vol%. 


4 A roving, or tow, is a loose and untwisted bundle of continuous fibers that are drawn 
together as parallel strands.

At room temperature the thermoset matrix undergoes curing reactions; there¬ 
fore, the prepreg is stored at 0°C (32°F) or lower. Also, the time in use at room tem¬ 
perature (or out-time ) must be minimized. If properly handled, thermoset prepregs 
have a lifetime of at least six months and usually longer. 

Both thermoplastic and thermosetting resins are used; carbon, glass, and aramid 
fibers are the common reinforcements. 

Actual fabrication begins with the lay-up— laying of the prepreg tape onto a 
tooled surface. Normally a number of plies are laid up (after removal from the car¬ 
rier backing paper) to provide the desired thickness. The lay-up arrangement may 
be unidirectional, but more often the fiber orientation is alternated to produce a 
cross-ply or angle-ply laminate. Final curing is accomplished by the simultaneous 
application of heat and pressure. 

The lay-up procedure may be carried out entirely by hand (hand lay-up), wherein 
the operator both cuts the lengths of tape and then positions them in the desired ori¬ 
entation on the tooled surface. Alternately, tape patterns may be machine cut, then 
hand laid. Fabrication costs can be further reduced by automation of prepreg lay-up 
and other manufacturing procedures (e.g., filament winding, as discussed next), which 
virtually eliminates the need for hand labor. These automated methods are essential 
for many applications of composite materials to be cost effective. 

Filament Winding 

Filament winding is a process by which continuous reinforcing fibers are accurately 
positioned in a predetermined pattern to form a hollow (usually cylindrical) shape. 
The fibers, either as individual strands or as tows, are first fed through a resin bath 
and then are continuously wound onto a mandrel, usually using automated wind¬ 
ing equipment (Figure 16.15). After the appropriate number of layers have been 
applied, curing is carried out either in an oven or at room temperature, after which 
the mandrel is removed. As an alternative, narrow and thin prepregs (i.e., tow pregs) 
10 mm or less in width may be filament wound. 

Various winding patterns are possible (i.e., circumferential, helical, and polar) 
to give the desired mechanical characteristics. Filament-wound parts have very high 
strength-to-weight ratios. Also, a high degree of control over winding uniformity

and orientation is afforded with this technique. Furthermore, when automated, the 
process is most economically attractive. Common filament-wound structures include 
rocket motor casings, storage tanks and pipes, and pressure vessels. 

Manufacturing techniques are now being used to produce a wide variety of 
structural shapes that are not necessarily limited to surfaces of revolution (e.g., 
I-beams). This technology is advancing very rapidly because it is very cost effective. 

Structural Composites 

structural A structural composite is normally composed of both homogeneous and compos- 

composite ite materials, the properties of which depend not only on the properties of the con¬ 

stituent materials but also on the geometrical design of the various structural ele¬ 
ments. Laminar composites and sandwich panels are two of the most common 
structural composites; only a relatively superficial examination is offered here for 
them. 

16.14 LAMINAR COMPOSITES 

laminar composite A laminar composite is composed of two-dimensional sheets or panels that have a 
preferred high-strength direction, such as is found in wood and continuous and 
aligned fiber-reinforced plastics. The layers are stacked and subsequently cemented 
together such that the orientation of the high-strength direction varies with each 
successive layer (Figure 16.16). For example, adjacent wood sheets in plywood are 
aligned with the grain direction at right angles to each other. Laminations may also 
be constructed using fabric material such as cotton, paper, or woven glass fibers em¬ 
bedded in a plastic matrix. Thus a laminar composite has relatively high strength in 
a number of directions in the two-dimensional plane; however, the strength in any 
given direction is, of course, lower than it would be if all the fibers were oriented 
in that direction. One example of a relatively complex laminated structure is the 
modern ski (see the chapter-opening illustration for this chapter).

oriented fiber-reinforced layers for a laminar 
composite. 



16.15 SANDWICH PANELS 

sandwich panel Sandwich panels, considered to be a class of structural composites, are designed to 

be lightweight beams or panels having relatively high stiffnesses and strengths. A 
sandwich panel consists of two outer sheets, or faces, that are separated by and ad¬ 
hesively bonded to a thicker core (Figure 16.17). The outer sheets are made of a 
relatively stiff and strong material, typically aluminum alloys, fiber-reinforced plas¬ 
tics, titanium, steel, or plywood; they impart high stiffness and strength to the struc¬ 
ture and must be thick enough to withstand tensile and compressive stresses that 
result from loading. The core material is lightweight and normally has a low mod¬ 
ulus of elasticity. Core materials typically fall within three categories: rigid polymeric 
foams (i.e., phenolics, epoxy, polyurethanes), wood (i.e., balsa wood), and honey¬ 
combs (discussed shortly). 

Structurally, the core serves several functions. First of ah, it provides continuous 
support for the faces. In addition, it must have sufficient shear strength to withstand 
transverse shear stresses and also be thick enough to provide high shear stiffness 
(to resist buckling of the panel). (Tensile and compressive stresses on the core are 
much lower than on the faces.) 

Another popular core consists of a “honeycomb” structure—thin foils that have 
been formed into interlocking hexagonal cells, with axes oriented perpendicular to 

Figure 16.17

section of a sandwich

the face planes; Figure 16.18 shows a cutaway view of a honeycomb core sandwich 
panel. The honeycomb material is normally either an aluminum alloy or aramid 
polymer. Strength and stiffness of honeycomb structures depend on cell size, cell 
wall thickness, and the material from which the honeycomb is made. 

Sandwich panels are used in a wide variety of applications including roofs, floors, 
and walls of buildings and in aerospace and aircraft (i.e., for wings, fuselage, and 
tailplane skins). 


MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Nanocomposites in Tennis Balls 


N anocomposites —composites that consist of 
nanosized particles embedded in some type of 
matrix—are a group of promising new materials that 
will undoubtedly become infused with some of our 
modern technologies. In fact, one type of nanocom¬ 
posite is currently being used in high-performance 
tennis balls. These balls retain their original pressure 
and bounce twice as long as conventional ones. Air 
permeation through the walls of the ball is inhibited 
by a factor of two due to the presence of a flexible 
and very thin (10 to 50 |xm) nanocomposite barrier 
coating that covers the inner core; 5 a schematic di¬ 
agram of the cross-section of one of these tennis 


balls is shown in Figure 16.19. Because of their out¬ 
standing characteristics, these Double Core balls 
have recently been selected as the official balls for 
some of the major tennis tournaments. 

This nanocomposite coating consists of a ma¬ 
trix of butyl rubber, within which is embedded thin 
platelets of vermiculite, 6 a natural clay mineral. 
The vermiculite platelets exist as single-molecule 
thin sheets —on the order of a nanometer thick— 
that have a very large aspect ratio (of about 
10,000); aspect ratio is the ratio of the lateral di¬ 
mensions of a platelet to its thickness. Furthermore, 
the vermiculite platelets are exfoliated —that is, 


5 This coating was developed by InMat Inc., and is called Air D-Fense. Wilson Sporting Goods has incorporated 
this coating in its Double Core tennis balls.

they remain separated from one another. Also, 
within the butyl rubber, the vermiculite platelets 
are aligned such that all their lateral axes lie in the 
same plane; and throughout this barrier coating 
are multiple layers of these platelets (per the in¬ 
set of Figure 16.19). 

The presence of the vermiculite platelets ac¬ 
counts for the ability of the nanocomposite coat¬ 
ing to more effectively retain air pressure within 
the tennis balls. These platelets act as multilayer 
barriers to the diffusion of air molecules and slow

section of a high-performance Double Core tennis 
ball. The inset drawing presents a detailed view of the

permeation. 


down the diffusion rate; that is, the diffusion path 
length of air molecules is enhanced significantly 
because the air molecules must bypass these par¬ 
ticles as they diffuse through the coating. Also, the 
addition of the particles to the butyl rubber does 
not diminish its flexibility. 

It is anticipated that this type of coating can 
also be applied to other kinds of sporting equip¬ 
ment (i.e., soccer balls, footballs, bicycle tires), as 
well as to automobile tires (which would be lighter 
in weight and more recyclable).

SUMMARY 


Introduction 

• Composites are artificially produced multiphase materials having desirable com¬ 
binations of the best properties of the constituent phases. 

• Usually, one phase (the matrix) is continuous and completely surrounds the other 
(the dispersed phase). 

• In this discussion, composites were classified as particle-reinforced, fiber-reinforced, 
and structural. 














664 * Chapter 16 / Composites 

Large-Particle Composites 

Dispersion-Strengthened Composites 

• Large-particle and dispersion-strengthened composites fall within the particle- 
reinforced classification. 

• For dispersion strengthening, improved strength is achieved by extremely small 
particles of the dispersed phase, which inhibit dislocation motion. 

• The particle size is normally greater with large-particle composites, whose me¬ 
chanical characteristics are enhanced by reinforcement action. 

• For large-particle composites, upper and lower elastic modulus values depend on 
the moduli and volume fractions of matrix and particulate phases according to 
the rule-of-mixtures expressions Equations 16.1 and 16.2. 

• Concrete, a type of large-particle composite, consists of an aggregate of particles 
bonded together with cement. In the case of portland cement concrete, the 
aggregate consists of sand and gravel; the cementitious bond develops as a result 
of chemical reactions between the portland cement and water. 

• The mechanical strength of concrete may be improved by reinforcement meth¬ 
ods (e.g., embedment into the fresh concrete of steel rods, wires, etc.). 

Influence of Fiber Length 

• Of the several composite types, the potential for reinforcement efficiency is great¬ 
est for those that are fiber-reinforced. 

• With fiber-reinforced composites, an applied load is transmitted to and distrib¬ 
uted among the fibers via the matrix phase, which in most cases is at least mod¬ 
erately ductile. 

• Significant reinforcement is possible only if the matrix-fiber bond is strong. 
Because reinforcement discontinues at the fiber extremities, reinforcement efficiency 
depends on fiber length. 

• For each fiber-matrix combination, there exists some critical length (/ c ), which 
depends on fiber diameter and strength, and fiber-matrix bond strength accord¬ 
ing to Equation 16.3. 

• The length of continuous fibers greatly exceeds this critical value (i.e., / > 15/ c ), 
whereas shorter fibers are discontinuous. 

Influence of Fiber Orientation and Concentration 

• On the basis of fiber length and orientation, three different types of fiber-reinforced 
composites are possible: 

Continuous and aligned (Figure 16.8a)—mechanical properties are highly 
anisotropic. In the alignment direction, reinforcement and strength are a 
maximum; perpendicular to the alignment, they are a minimum. 

Discontinuous and aligned (Figure 16.8Z>)—significant strengths and stiffnesses 
are possible in the longitudinal direction. 

Discontinuous and randomly oriented (Figure 16.8c)—despite some limitations 
on reinforcement efficiency, properties are isotropic. 

• For continuous and aligned, rule-of-mixtures expressions for the modulus in 
both longitudinal and transverse orientations were developed (Equations 16.10 
and 16.16). In addition, an equation for longitudinal strength was also cited 
(Equation 16.17). 

• For discontinuous and aligned, composite strength equations were presented for 
two different situations: 


Summary * 665 


When / > l c , Equation 16.18 is valid. 

When / < l c , it is appropriate to use Equation 16.19. 

• The elastic modulus for discontinuous and randomly oriented fibrous composites 
may be determined using Equation 16.20. 

The Fiber Phase 

• On the basis of diameter and material type, fiber reinforcements are classified as 
follows: 

Whiskers—extremely strong single crystals that have very small diameters 

Fibers—normally polymers or ceramics that may be either amorphous or 
polycrystalline 

Wires—metals/alloys that have relatively large diameters 

The Matrix Phase 

• Although all three basic material types are used for matrices, the most common 
are polymers and metals. 

• The matrix phase normally performs three functions: 

It binds the fibers together and transmits an externally applied load to the 
fibers. 

It protects the individual fibers from surface damage. 

It prevents the propagation of cracks from fiber to fiber. 

• Fibrous reinforced composites are sometimes classified according to matrix type; 
within this scheme are three classifications: polymer-, metal-, and ceramic-matrix. 

Polymer-Matrix Composites 

• Polymer-matrix composites are the most common; they may be reinforced with 
glass, carbon, and aramid fibers. 

Metal-Matrix Composites 

• Service temperatures are higher for metal-matrix composites than for polymer- 
matrix composites. MMCs also use a variety of fiber and whisker types. 

Ceramic-Matrix Composites 

• With ceramic-matrix composites, the design goal is increased fracture toughness. 
This is achieved by interactions between advancing cracks and dispersed phase 
particles. 

• Transformation toughening is one such technique for improving K Ic . 

Carbon-Carbon Composites 

• Carbon-carbon composites are composed of carbon fibers embedded in a pyrolyzed 
carbon matrix. 

• These materials are expensive and used in applications requiring high strengths 
and stiffnesses (that are retained at elevated temperatures), resistance to creep, 
and good fracture toughnesses. 

Hybrid Composites 

• The hybrid composites contain at least two different fiber types. Using hybrids it 
is possible to design composites having better all-around sets of properties. 


666 * Chapter 16 / Composites 


Processing of Fiber-Reinforced Composites 

• Several composite processing techniques have been developed that provide a uni¬ 
form fiber distribution and a high degree of alignment. 

• With pultrusion, components of continuous length and constant cross section are 
formed as resin-impregnated fiber tows are pulled through a die. 

• Composites used for many structural applications are commonly prepared using 
a lay-up operation (either hand or automated), wherein prepreg tape plies are 
laid down on a tooled surface and are subsequently fully cured by the simulta¬ 
neous application of heat and pressure. 

• Some hollow structures may be fabricated using automated filament winding pro¬ 
cedures, whereby resin-coated strands or tows or prepreg tape are continuously 
wound onto a mandrel, followed by a curing operation. 

Structural Composites 

• Two general kinds of structural composites were discussed: laminar composites 
and sandwich panels. 

Laminar composites are virtually isotropic in a two-dimensional plane. This 
is made possible with several sheets of a highly anisotropic composite, which 
are cemented onto one another such that the high-strength direction is varied 
with each successive layer. 

Sandwich panels consist of two strong and stiff sheet faces that are separated 
by a core material or structure. These structures combine relatively high 
strengths and stiffnesses with low densities.

ure 16.11 is to be designed that has an out¬ 
side diameter of 80 mm (3.15 in.) and a 
length of 0.75 m (2.46 ft). The mechanical 
characteristic of prime importance is bend¬ 
ing stiffness in terms of the longitudinal 
modulus of elasticity. Stiffness is to be spec¬

Degradation of Materials 



I op: Photograph of a 1936 Deluxe Ford Sedan having a body that is made entirely of unpainted stainless steel. Six of 
these cars were manufactured to provide an ultimate test as to the durability and corrosion resistance of stainless steels. Each 
automobile has logged hundreds of thousands miles of everyday driving. Whereas the surface finish on the stainless steel is 
essentially the same as when the car left the manufacturer's assembly line, other nonstainless components such as the engine, 

shock absorbers, brakes, springs, clutch, transmission, and gears have 
had to be replaced; for example, one car has gone through three 
engines. 

Bottom: By way of contrast, a classic automobile of the same 
vintage as the one above that is rusting away in a field in Bodie, 
California. Its body is made of a plain-carbon steel that at one time 
was painted. This paint offered limited protection for the steel, 
which is susceptible to corrosion in normal atmospheric environ¬ 
ments.

WHY STUDY Corrosion and Degradation of Materials? 


With a knowledge of the types of and an understand¬ 
ing of the mechanisms and causes of corrosion and 
degradation, it is possible to take measures to prevent 
them from occurring. For example, we may change the 


nature of the environment, select a material that is 
relatively nonreactive, and/or protect the material 
from appreciable deterioration. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Distinguish between oxidation and reduction 
electrochemical reactions. 

2. Describe the following: galvanic couple, standard 
half-cell, and standard hydrogen electrode. 

3. Compute the cell potential and write the 
spontaneous electrochemical reaction direction 
for two pure metals that are electrically 
connected and also submerged in solutions of 
their respective ions. 

4. Determine metal oxidation rate given the 
reaction current density. 

5. Name and briefly describe the two different 
types of polarization, and specify the conditions 
under which each is rate controlling. 


6. For each of the eight forms of corrosion and 
hydrogen embrittlement, describe the nature 
of the deteriorative process, and then note the 
proposed mechanism. 

7. List five measures that are commonly used to 
prevent corrosion. 

8. Explain why ceramic materials are, in general, 
very resistant to corrosion. 

9. For polymeric materials, discuss (a) two 
degradation processes that occur when they are 
exposed to liquid solvents and (b) the causes 
and consequences of molecular chain bond 
rupture. 


17.1 INTRODUCTION 

To one degree or another, most materials experience some type of interaction with 
a large number of diverse environments. Often, such interactions impair a mater¬ 
ial’s usefulness as a result of the deterioration of its mechanical properties (e.g., 
ductility and strength), other physical properties, or appearance. Occasionally, to the 
chagrin of a design engineer, the degradation behavior of a material for some ap¬ 
plication is ignored, with adverse consequences. 

Deteriorative mechanisms are different for the three material types. In met- 
corrosion als, there is actual material loss either by dissolution (corrosion) or by the forma¬ 

tion of nonmetallic scale or film ( oxidation ). Ceramic materials are relatively 
resistant to deterioration, which usually occurs at elevated temperatures or in 
rather extreme environments; the process is frequently also called corrosion. For 
polymers, mechanisms and consequences differ from those for metals and ceram- 
degradation ics, and the term degradation is most frequently used. Polymers may dissolve when 

exposed to a liquid solvent, or they may absorb the solvent and swell; also, elec¬ 
tromagnetic radiation (primarily ultraviolet) and heat may cause alterations in their 
molecular structures. 

The deterioration of each of these material types is discussed in this chapter, 
with special regard to mechanism, resistance to attack by various environments, and 
measures to prevent or reduce degradation.

Corrosion of Metals 


Corrosion is defined as the destructive and unintentional attack of a metal; it is 
electrochemical and ordinarily begins at the surface. The problem of metallic cor¬ 
rosion is one of significant proportions; in economic terms, it has been estimated 
that approximately 5% of an industrialized nation’s income is spent on corrosion 
prevention and the maintenance or replacement of products lost or contaminated 
as a result of corrosion reactions. The consequences of corrosion are all too com¬ 
mon. Familiar examples include the rusting of automotive body panels and radia¬ 
tor and exhaust components. 

Corrosion processes are occasionally used to advantage. For example, etching 
procedures, as discussed in Section 4.10, make use of the selective chemical reac¬ 
tivity of grain boundaries or various microstructural constituents. 


17.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

For metallic materials, the corrosion process is normally electrochemical, that is, a 
chemical reaction in which there is transfer of electrons from one chemical species 
to another. Metal atoms characteristically lose or give up electrons in what is called 
oxidation an oxidation reaction. For example, a hypothetical metal M that has a valence of n 

(or n valence electrons) may experience oxidation according to the reaction 


Oxidation reaction 
for metal M 


anode 


reduction 


M -> M n+ + ne~ (17.1) 

in which M becomes an n+ positively charged ion and in the process loses its n valence 
electrons; e~ is used to symbolize an electron. Examples in which metals oxidize are 

Fe -> Fe 2+ + 2e~ (17.2a) 

A1-> Al 3+ + 3e~ (17.2b) 

The site at which oxidation takes place is called the anode; oxidation is sometimes 
called an anodic reaction. 

The electrons generated from each metal atom that is oxidized must be 
transferred to and become a part of another chemical species in what is termed 
a reduction reaction. For example, some metals undergo corrosion in acid solu¬ 
tions, which have a high concentration of hydrogen (H + ) ions; the H + ions are 
reduced as follows:

hydrogen ions in an 
acid solution

oxygen 

Reduction reaction 
in a neutral or basic 
solution containing 
dissolved oxygen 


2H + + 2e~ -> H 2 (17.3) 

and hydrogen gas (H 2 ) is evolved. 

Other reduction reactions are possible, depending on the nature of the solution 
to which the metal is exposed. For an acid solution having dissolved oxygen, 
reduction according to 


0 2 + 4H + + 4e“ -> 2H 2 0 (17.4) 

will probably occur. Or, for a neutral or basic aqueous solution in which oxygen is 
also dissolved, 


0 2 + 2H 2 0 + 4e“ -> 4(OH“)

solution. (From M. G. Fontana, Corrosion

Any metal ions present in the solution may also be reduced; for ions that can exist 
in more than one valence state (multivalent ions), reduction may occur by 

M" + + e~ -» M ( "“ 1)+ (17.6) 

in which the metal ion decreases its valence state by accepting an electron. Or a 
metal may be totally reduced from an ionic to a neutral metallic state according to 

M n+ + ne~ -> M (17.7) 

The location at which reduction occurs is called the cathode. Furthermore, it is 
possible for two or more of the preceding reduction reactions to occur simulta¬ 
neously. 

An overall electrochemical reaction must consist of at least one oxidation and 
one reduction reaction, and will be the sum of them; often the individual oxidation 
and reduction reactions are termed half-reactions. There can be no net electrical 
charge accumulation from the electrons and ions; that is, the total rate of oxidation 
must equal the total rate of reduction, or all electrons generated through oxidation 
must be consumed by reduction. 

For example, consider zinc metal immersed in an acid solution containing H + 
ions. At some regions on the metal surface, zinc will experience oxidation or cor¬ 
rosion as illustrated in Figure 17.1, and according to the reaction 

Zn-> Zn 2+ + 2e~ (17.8) 

Because zinc is a metal, and therefore a good electrical conductor, these electrons may 
be transferred to an adjacent region at which the H + ions are reduced according to 

2H + + 2e~ -> H 2 (gas) (17.9) 

If no other oxidation or reduction reactions occur, the total electrochemical reac¬ 
tion is just the sum of reactions 17.8 and 17.9, or 

Zn-> Zn 2+ + 2e~ 

2H + + 2e~ -> H 2 (gas) 

Zn + 2H + -> Zn 2+ + H 2 (gas) (17.10) 

Another example is the oxidation or rusting of iron in water, which contains 

dissolved oxygen. This process occurs in two steps; in the first, Fe is oxidized to Fe 2+ 

[as Fe(OH) 2 ], 

Fe + \0 2 + H 2 0 -> Fe 2+ + 20H“ -> Fe(OH) 2 (17.11)

The compound Fe(OH) 3 is the all-too-familiar rust. 

As a consequence of oxidation, the metal ions may either go into the corrod¬ 
ing solution as ions (reaction 17.8), or they may form an insoluble compound with 
nonmetallic elements as in reaction 17.12.

Electrode Potentials 

Not all metallic materials oxidize to form ions with the same degree of ease. Con¬ 
sider the electrochemical cell shown in Figure 17.2. On the left-hand side is a piece 
of pure iron immersed in a solution containing Fe 2+ ions of 1 M concentration. 1 * The 
other side of the cell consists of a pure copper electrode in a 1 M solution of Cu 2+ 
ions. The cell halves are separated by a membrane, which limits the mixing of the 
two solutions. If the iron and copper electrodes are connected electrically, reduc¬ 
tion will occur for copper at the expense of the oxidation of iron, as follows: 

Cu 2+ + Fe-> Cu + Fe 2+ (17.13) 

or Cu 2+ ions will deposit (electrodeposit) as metallic copper on the copper elec¬ 
trode, while iron dissolves (corrodes) on the other side of the cell and goes into so¬ 
lution as Fe 2+ ions. Thus, the two half-cell reactions are represented by the relations 

Fe -> Fe 2+ + 2e~ (17.14a) 

Cu 2+ + 2e~ -> Cu (17.14b)

Figure 17.3 An electrochemical cell 
consisting of iron and zinc electrodes, each of 
which is immersed in a 1 M solution of its ion. 
The iron electrodeposits while the zinc 
corrodes. 


When a current passes through the external circuit, electrons generated from the oxi¬ 
dation of iron flow to the copper cell in order that Cu 2+ be reduced. In addition, there 
will be some net ion motion from each cell to the other across the membrane. This is 
called a galvanic couple —two metals electrically connected in a liquid electrolyte 
wherein one metal becomes an anode and corrodes, while the other acts as a cathode. 

An electric potential or voltage will exist between the two cell halves, and its 
magnitude can be determined if a voltmeter is connected in the external circuit. A 
potential of 0.780 V results for a copper-iron galvanic cell when the temperature 
is 25°C (77°F). 

Now consider another galvanic couple consisting of the same iron half-cell con¬ 
nected to a metal zinc electrode that is immersed in a 1 M solution of Zn 2+ ions 
(Figure 17.3). In this case the zinc is the anode and corrodes, whereas the Fe now 
becomes the cathode. The electrochemical reaction is thus 

Fe 2+ + Zn -> Fe + Zn 2+ (17.15) 

The potential associated with this cell reaction is 0.323 V. 

Thus, various electrode pairs have different voltages; the magnitude of such a 
voltage may be thought of as representing the driving force for the electrochemi¬ 
cal oxidation-reduction reaction. Consequently, metallic materials may be rated as 
to their tendency to experience oxidation when coupled to other metals in solu¬ 
tions of their respective ions. A half-cell similar to those just described [i.e., a pure 
metal electrode immersed in a 1 M solution of its ions and at 25°C (77°F)] is termed 
a standard half-cell. 

The Standard emf Series 

These measured cell voltages represent only differences in electrical potential, and 
thus it is convenient to establish a reference point, or reference cell, to which other 
cell halves may be compared. This reference cell, arbitrarily chosen, is the standard 
hydrogen electrode (Figure 17.4). It consists of an inert platinum electrode in a 1 M 
solution of H + ions, saturated with hydrogen gas that is bubbled through the solution 
at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F). The platinum itself does not 
take part in the electrochemical reaction; it acts only as a surface on which hydrogen

atoms may be oxidized or hydrogen ions may be reduced. The electromotive force 
(emf) series (Table 17.1) is generated by coupling to the standard hydrogen electrode, 
standard half-cells for various metals and ranking them according to measured volt¬ 
age. Table 17.1 represents the corrosion tendencies for the several metals; those at the 
top (i.e., gold and platinum) are noble, or chemically inert. Moving down the table, 
the metals become increasingly more active, that is, more susceptible to oxidation. 
Sodium and potassium have the highest reactivities. 

The voltages in Table 17.1 are for the half-reactions as reduction reactions , with 
the electrons on the left-hand side of the chemical equation; for oxidation, the 
direction of the reaction is reversed and the sign of the voltage changed.

Consider the generalized reactions involving the oxidation of metal and the 
reduction of metal M 2 as

standard half-cells 
that are electrically 
coupled 


M x -> M? + + ne~ - V? (17.16a) 

MV + ne~ -» M 2 + V° 2 (17.16b) 

where the Vs are the standard potentials as taken from the standard emf series. 
Because metal is oxidized, the sign of V? is opposite to that as it appears in 
Table 17.1. Addition of Equations 17.16a and 17.16b yields 

M 1 + M? + -> M? + + M 2 (17.17) 

and the overall cell potential AV° is 

AV° = V° 2 - Vi (17.18) 

For this reaction to occur spontaneously, AV° must be positive; if it is negative, 
the spontaneous cell direction is just the reverse of Equation 17.17. When standard 
half-cells are coupled together, the metal that lies lower in Table 17.1 will experi¬ 
ence oxidation (i.e., corrosion), whereas the higher one will be reduced.

Influence of Concentration and Temperature 
on Cell Potential 

The emf series applies to highly idealized electrochemical cells (i.e., pure metals in 
1 M solutions of their ions, at 25°C). Altering temperature or solution concentra¬ 
tion or using alloy electrodes instead of pure metals will change the cell potential, 
and, in some cases, the spontaneous reaction direction may be reversed. 

Consider again the electrochemical reaction described by Equation 17.17. If 
and M 2 electrodes are pure metals, the cell potential depends on the absolute tem¬ 
perature T and the molar ion concentrations [M^ + ] and [M 2 + ] according to the 
Nernst equation: 


AV = (V 2 ° - V?) - (17.19) 

V 2 l> n® [MV] 

where R is the gas constant, n is the number of electrons participating in either of the 
half-cell reactions, and 2F is the Faraday constant, 96,500 C/mol—the magnitude of 
charge per mole (6.022 X 10 23 ) of electrons. At 25°C (about room temperature),

to give AV in volts. Again, for reaction spontaneity, AV must be positive. As expected, 
for 1 M concentrations of both ion types (that is, [Mf + ] = [M 2 + ] = 1), Equation 
17.19 simplifies to Equation 17.18.

galvanic series 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 17.1 


Determination of Electrochemical Cell Characteristics 

One-half of an electrochemical cell consists of a pure nickel electrode in a solution 
of Ni 2+ ions; the other half is a cadmium electrode immersed in a Cd 2+ solution. 

(a) If the cell is a standard one, write the spontaneous overall reaction and 
calculate the voltage that is generated. 

(b) Compute the cell potential at 25°C if the Cd 2+ and Ni 2+ concentrations 
are 0.5 and 10 -3 M, respectively. Is the spontaneous reaction direction still the 
same as for the standard cell? 


Solution 

(a) The cadmium electrode will be oxidized and nickel reduced because cad¬ 
mium is lower in the emf series; thus, the spontaneous reactions will be 

Cd-> Cd 2+ + 2e~ 

Ni 2+ + 2e~ -> Ni_ 

Ni 2+ + Cd -> Ni + Cd 2+ (17.21) 

From Table 17.1, the half-cell potentials for cadmium and nickel are, 
respectively, -0.403 and -0.250 V. Therefore, from Equation 17.18, 

AC = V° Ni - V° cd = -0.250 V - (-0.403 V) = +0.153 V 

(b) For this portion of the problem, Equation 17.20 must be used, because the 
half-cell solution concentrations are no longer 1 M. At this point it is necessary 
to make a calculated guess as to which metal species is oxidized (or reduced). 
This choice will either be affirmed or refuted on the basis of the sign of AC at 
the conclusion of the computation. For the sake of argument, let us assume that 
in contrast to part (a), nickel is oxidized and cadmium reduced according to 

Cd 2+ + Ni -> Cd + Ni 2+ (17.22) 


Thus, 


AV = (V8d - Vgi) - ^ln+y 
v ca ni; ngf [Cd 2+ ] 

= -0.403 V - (-0.250 V) - lo §(f^ 

= -0.073 V 


Because AC is negative, the spontaneous reaction direction is the opposite to 
that of Equation 17.22, or 

Ni 2+ + Cd -> Ni + Cd 2+ 


That is, cadmium is oxidized and nickel is reduced. 


The Galvanic Series 

Even though Table 17.1 was generated under highly idealized conditions and has 
limited utility, it nevertheless indicates the relative reactivities of the metals. A 
more realistic and practical ranking, however, is provided by the galvanic series, 
Table 17.2. This represents the relative reactivities of a number of metals and com¬ 
mercial alloys in seawater. The alloys near the top are cathodic and unreactive,

whereas those at the bottom are most anodic; no voltages are provided. Compari¬ 
son of the standard emf and the galvanic series reveals a high degree of corre¬ 
spondence between the relative positions of the pure base metals. 

Most metals and alloys are subject to oxidation or corrosion to one degree or 
another in a wide variety of environments; that is, they are more stable in an ionic 
state than as metals. In thermodynamic terms, there is a net decrease in free energy 
in going from metallic to oxidized states. Consequently, essentially all metals occur 
in nature as compounds—for example, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, silicates, sul¬ 
fides, and sulfates. Two notable exceptions are the noble metals gold and platinum. 
For them, oxidation in most environments is not favorable, and, therefore, they may 
exist in nature in the metallic state. 

17.3 CORROSION RATES 

The half-cell potentials listed in Table 17.1 are thermodynamic parameters that 
relate to systems at equilibrium. For example, for the discussions pertaining to 
Figures 17.2 and 17.3, it was tacitly assumed that there was no current flow through 
the external circuit. Real corroding systems are not at equilibrium; there will be a 
flow of electrons from anode to cathode (corresponding to the short-circuiting of 
the electrochemical cells in Figures 17.2 and 17.3), which means that the half-cell 
potential parameters (Table 17.1) cannot be applied. 

Furthermore, these half-cell potentials represent the magnitude of a driving force, 
or the tendency for the occurrence of the particular half-cell reaction. However, 








17.4 Prediction of Corrosion Rates * 683 


although these potentials may be used to determine spontaneous reaction directions, 
they provide no information as to corrosion rates. That is, even though a AV poten¬ 
tial computed for a specific corrosion situation using Equation 17.20 is a relatively 
large positive number, the reaction may occur at only an insignificantly slow rate. 
From an engineering perspective, we are interested in predicting the rates at which 
systems corrode; this requires the use of other parameters, as discussed next. 

The corrosion rate, or the rate of material removal as a consequence of the 
chemical action, is an important corrosion parameter. This may be expressed as the 
corrosion penetration rate (CPR), or the thickness loss of material per unit of time. 
The formula for this calculation is 

KW 

CPR = —- (17.23) 

pAt 

where W is the weight loss after exposure time t\ p and A represent the density and 
exposed specimen area, respectively, and K is a constant, its magnitude depending on 
the system of units used. The CPR is conveniently expressed in terms of either mils 
per year (mpy) or millimeters per year (mm/yr). In the first case, K = 534 to give CPR 
in mpy (where 1 mil = 0.001 in.), and W, p,A , and t are specified in units of milligrams, 
grams per cubic centimeter, square inches, and hours, respectively. In the second case, 
K = 87.6 for mm/yr, and units for the other parameters are the same as for mils per 
year, except that A is given in square centimeters. For most applications a corrosion 
penetration rate less than about 20 mpy (0.50 mm/yr) is acceptable. 

Inasmuch as there is an electric current associated with electrochemical corro¬ 
sion reactions, we can also express corrosion rate in terms of this current, or, more 
specifically, current density—that is, the current per unit surface area of material 
corroding—which is designated i. The rate r, in units of mol/m 2 • s, is determined using 
the expression 

r = - l ~ (17.24) 

n3? v ’ 

where, again, n is the number of electrons associated with the ionization of each 
metal atom, and 8F is 96,500 C/mol. 

17.4 PREDICTION OF CORROSION RATES 

Polarization 

Consider the standard Zn/H 2 electrochemical cell shown in Figure 17.5, which has 
been short-circuited such that oxidation of zinc and reduction of hydrogen will oc¬ 
cur at their respective electrode surfaces. The potentials of the two electrodes will 
not be at the values determined from Table 17.1 because the system is now a non¬ 
equilibrium one. The displacement of each electrode potential from its equilibrium 
polarization value is termed polarization, and the magnitude of this displacement is the over¬ 

voltage, normally represented by the symbol 77. Overvoltage is expressed in terms 
of plus or minus volts (or millivolts) relative to the equilibrium potential. For ex¬ 
ample, suppose that the zinc electrode in Figure 17.5 has a potential of -0.621 V 
after it has been connected to the platinum electrode. The equilibrium potential is 
-0.763 V (Table 17.1), and, therefore, 

7] = -0.621 V - (-0.763 V) = +0.142 V 

There are two types of polarization—activation and concentration. We will now 
discuss their mechanisms because they control the rate of electrochemical reactions.

Activation Polarization 

All electrochemical reactions consist of a sequence of steps that occur in series at 
the interface between the metal electrode and the electrolyte solution. Activation 
polarization refers to the condition wherein the reaction rate is controlled by the 
one step in the series that occurs at the slowest rate. The term activation is applied 
to this type of polarization because an activation energy barrier is associated with 
this slowest, rate-limiting step. 

To illustrate, let us consider the reduction of hydrogen ions to form bubbles of 
hydrogen gas on the surface of a zinc electrode (Figure 17.6). It is conceivable that 
this reaction could proceed by the following step sequence: 

1. Adsorption of H + ions from the solution onto the zinc surface 

2. Electron transfer from the zinc to form a hydrogen atom, 

H + + e~ -> H 

3. Combining of two hydrogen atoms to form a molecule of hydrogen, 

2H-> H 2

of possible steps in the hydrogen 
reduction reaction, the rate of which 
is controlled by activation polarization.

The slowest of these steps determines the rate of the overall reaction. 

For activation polarization, the relationship between overvoltage r] a and current 
density i is 


Va = ± 13 log L (17.25) 

l 0 

where (3 and i 0 are constants for the particular half-cell. The parameter i 0 is termed 
the exchange current density , which deserves a brief explanation. Equilibrium for 
some particular half-cell reaction is really a dynamic state on the atomic level. That 
is, oxidation and reduction processes are occurring, but both at the same rate, so 
that there is no net reaction. For example, for the standard hydrogen cell (Figure 17.4), 
reduction of hydrogen ions in solution will take place at the surface of the platinum 
electrode according to 

2H + + 2e~ -> H 2 

with a corresponding rate r red . Similarly, hydrogen gas in the solution will experi¬ 
ence oxidation as 


H 2 -> 2H + + 2e~ 

at rate r oxid . Equilibrium exists when 

^red ^oxid 

This exchange current density is just the current density from Equation 17.24 at 
equilibrium, or 


''red = ''oxid = \ (17.26) 

n<r 

Use of the term current density for i 0 is a little misleading inasmuch as there is no 
net current. Furthermore, the value for i 0 is determined experimentally and will vary 
from system to system. 

According to Equation 17.25, when overvoltage is plotted as a function of the log¬ 
arithm of current density, straight-line segments result; these are shown in Figure 17.7

for the hydrogen electrode. The line segment with a slope of +/3 corresponds to the 
oxidation half-reaction, whereas the line with a —/3 slope is for reduction. Also worth 
noting is that both line segments originate at i 0 (H 2 /H + ), the exchange current density, 
and at zero overvoltage, because at this point the system is at equilibrium and there 
is no net reaction. 


Concentration Polarization 

Concentration polarization exists when the reaction rate is limited by diffusion in 
the solution. For example, consider again the hydrogen evolution reduction reac¬ 
tion. When the reaction rate is low and/or the concentration of H + is high, there is 
always an adequate supply of hydrogen ions available in the solution at the region 
near the electrode interface (Figure 17.8a). On the other hand, at high rates and/or 
low H + concentrations, a depletion zone may be formed in the vicinity of the in¬ 
terface, inasmuch as the H + ions are not replenished at a rate sufficient to keep up 
with the reaction (Figure 17.8 b). Thus, diffusion of H + to the interface is rate con¬ 
trolling, and the system is said to be concentration polarized. 

Concentration polarization data are also normally plotted as overvoltage ver¬ 
sus the logarithm of current density; such a plot is represented schematically in 
Figure 17.9a. 2 It may be noted from this figure that overvoltage is independent

Both concentration and activation polarization are possible for reduction re¬ 
actions. Under these circumstances, the total overvoltage is just the sum of both 
overvoltage contributions. Figure 17.96 shows such a schematic 77 -versus-log i plot.

Corrosion Rates from Polarization Data 

Let us now apply the concepts just developed to the determination of corrosion rates. 
Two types of systems will be discussed. In the first case, both oxidation and reduc¬ 
tion reactions are rate limited by activation polarization. In the second case, both 
concentration and activation polarization control the reduction reaction, whereas 
only activation polarization is important for oxidation. Case one will be illustrated 
by considering the corrosion of zinc immersed in an acid solution (see Figure 17.1). 














688 * Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 


The reduction of H + ions to form H 2 gas bubbles occurs at the surface of the zinc 

according to 


2H + + 2e~ -» H 2 

(17.3) 

and the zinc oxidizes as 


Zn-> Zn 2+ + 2e 

(17.8) 


No net charge accumulation may result from these two reactions; that is, all elec¬ 
trons generated by reaction 17.8 must be consumed by reaction 17.3, which is to 
say that rates of oxidation and reduction must be equal. 

Activation polarization for both reactions is expressed graphically in Figure 17.10 
as cell potential referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (not overvoltage) 
versus the logarithm of current density. The potentials of the uncoupled hydrogen 
and zinc half-cells, E(H + /H 2 ) and U(Zn/Zn 2+ ), respectively, are indicated, along with 
their respective exchange current densities, / 0 (H + /H 2 ) and / 0 (Zn/Zn 2+ ). Straight-line 
segments are shown for hydrogen reduction and zinc oxidation. Upon immersion, 
both hydrogen and zinc experience activation polarization along their respective 
lines. Also, oxidation and reduction rates must be equal as explained earlier, which 
is possible only at the intersection of the two line segments; this intersection occurs 
at the corrosion potential, designated V c , and the corrosion current density i c . The 
corrosion rate of zinc (which also corresponds to the rate of hydrogen evolution) 
may thus be computed by insertion of this i c value into Equation 17.24. 

The second corrosion case (combined activation and concentration polariza¬ 
tion for hydrogen reduction and activation polarization for oxidation of metal M) 
is treated in a like manner. Figure 17.11 shows both polarization curves; as earlier, 
corrosion potential and corrosion current density correspond to the point at which 
the oxidation and reduction lines intersect.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM 17.2 


Rate of Oxidation Computation 

Zinc experiences corrosion in an acid solution according to the reaction 
Zn + 2H + -> Zn 2+ + H 2 

The rates of both oxidation and reduction half-reactions are controlled by 
activation polarization. 

(a) Compute the rate of oxidation of Zn (in mol/cm 2 • s) given the following 
activation polarization data: 


For Zn 

For Hydrogen 

Vzn/Zn-) = -0.763 V 

^(h + /h 2 ) = 0 V 

i 0 = 10“ 7 A/cm 2 

/ 0 = 10“ 10 A/cm 2 

/3 = +0.09 

P = -0.08 


(b) Compute the value of the corrosion potential. 

Solution 

(a) To compute the rate of oxidation for Zn, it is first necessary to estab¬ 
lish relationships in the form of Equation 17.25 for the potential of both 
oxidation and reduction reactions. Next, these two expressions are set equal 
to one another, and then we solve for the value of i that is the corrosion 
current density, i c . Finally, the corrosion rate may be calculated using Equa¬ 
tion 17.24. The two potential expressions are as follows: For hydrogen 
reduction,

and for Zn oxidation.

Now, setting V H = V Zn leads to

(b) Now it becomes necessary to compute the value of the corrosion poten¬ 
tial V c . This is possible by using either of the preceding equations for V n or 
V Zn and substituting for i the value determined previously for i c . Thus, using 
the E h expression yields

This is the same problem that is represented and solved graphically in the 
voltage-versus-logarithm current density plot of Figure 17.10. It is worth noting 
that the i c and V c we have obtained by this analytical treatment are in agree¬ 
ment with those values occurring at the intersection of the two line segments 
on the plot. 


17.5 PASSIVITY 

Some normally active metals and alloys, under particular environmental conditions, 
lose their chemical reactivity and become extremely inert. This phenomenon, termed 
passivity passivity, is displayed by chromium, iron, nickel, titanium, and many of their alloys. 

It is felt that this passive behavior results from the formation of a highly adherent 
and very thin oxide film on the metal surface, which serves as a protective barrier 










17.5 Passivity • 691 


to further corrosion. Stainless steels are highly resistant to corrosion in a rather 
wide variety of atmospheres as a result of passivation. They contain at least 11% 
chromium that, as a solid-solution alloying element in iron, minimizes the forma¬ 
tion of rust; instead, a protective surface film forms in oxidizing atmospheres. (Stain¬ 
less steels are susceptible to corrosion in some environments, and therefore are not 
always “stainless.”) Aluminum is highly corrosion resistant in many environments 
because it also passivates. If damaged, the protective film normally re-forms very 
rapidly. However, a change in the character of the environment (e.g., alteration in 
the concentration of the active corrosive species) may cause a passivated material 
to revert to an active state. Subsequent damage to a preexisting passive film could 
result in a substantial increase in corrosion rate, by as much as 100,000 times. 

This passivation phenomenon may be explained in terms of polarization 
potential-log current density curves discussed in the preceding section. The polar¬ 
ization curve for a metal that passivates will have the general shape shown in 
Figure 17.12. At relatively low potential values, within the “active” region the be¬ 
havior is linear as it is for normal metals. With increasing potential, the current den¬ 
sity suddenly decreases to a very low value that remains independent of potential; 
this is termed the “passive” region. Finally, at even higher potential values, the cur¬ 
rent density again increases with potential in the “transpassive” region. 

Figure 17.13 illustrates how a metal can experience both active and passive 
behavior depending on the corrosion environment. Included in this figure is the 
S-shaped oxidation polarization curve for an active-passive metal M and, in addi¬ 
tion, reduction polarization curves for two different solutions, which are labeled 1 
and 2. Curve 1 intersects the oxidation polarization curve in the active region at 
point A , yielding a corrosion current density i c (A). The intersection of curve 2 at 
point B is in the passive region and at current density i c (B). The corrosion rate 
of metal M in solution 1 is greater than in solution 2 since / C (A) is greater than 
i c (B ) and rate is proportional to current density according to Equation 17.24. This 
difference in corrosion rate between the two solutions may be significant—several 
orders of magnitude—when one considers that the current density scale in Figure 17.13 
is scaled logarithmically.

17.6 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS 

The variables in the corrosion environment, which include fluid velocity, temperature, 
and composition, can have a decided influence on the corrosion properties of the ma¬ 
terials that are in contact with it. In most instances, increasing fluid velocity enhances 
the rate of corrosion due to erosive effects, as discussed later in the chapter. The rates 
of most chemical reactions rise with increasing temperature; this also holds for most 
corrosion situations. Increasing the concentration of the corrosive species (e.g., H + 
ions in acids) in many situations produces a more rapid rate of corrosion. However, 
for materials capable of passivation, raising the corrosive content may result in an ac- 
tive-to-passive transition, with a considerable reduction in corrosion. 

Cold working or plastically deforming ductile metals is used to increase their 
strength; however, a cold-worked metal is more susceptible to corrosion than the 
same material in an annealed state. For example, deformation processes are used 
to shape the head and point of a nail; consequently, these positions are anodic with 
respect to the shank region. Thus, differential cold working on a structure should 
be a consideration when a corrosive environment may be encountered during service. 

17.7 FORMS OF CORROSION 

It is convenient to classify corrosion according to the manner in which it is mani¬ 
fest. Metallic corrosion is sometimes classified into eight forms: uniform, galvanic, 
crevice, pitting, intergranular, selective leaching, erosion-corrosion, and stress cor¬ 
rosion. The causes and means of prevention of each of these forms are discussed 
briefly. In addition, we have elected to discuss the topic of hydrogen embrittlement 
in this section. Hydrogen embrittlement is, in a strict sense, a type of failure rather 
than a form of corrosion; however, it is often produced by hydrogen that is gener¬ 
ated from corrosion reactions. 

Uniform Attack 

Uniform attack is a form of electrochemical corrosion that occurs with equivalent in¬ 
tensity over the entire exposed surface and often leaves behind a scale or deposit. In 
a microscopic sense, the oxidation and reduction reactions occur randomly over the 








17.7 Forms of Corrosion • 693 


surface. Some familiar examples include general rusting of steel and iron and the tar¬ 
nishing of silverware. This is probably the most common form of corrosion. It is also 
the least objectionable because it can be predicted and designed for with relative ease. 

Galvanic Corrosion 

galvanic corrosion Galvanic corrosion occurs when two metals or alloys having different compositions 
are electrically coupled while exposed to an electrolyte. This is the type of corro¬ 
sion or dissolution that was described in Section 17.2. The less noble or more reac¬ 
tive metal in the particular environment will experience corrosion; the more inert 
metal, the cathode, will be protected from corrosion. For example, steel screws cor¬ 
rode when in contact with brass in a marine environment; or if copper and steel 
tubing are joined in a domestic water heater, the steel will corrode in the vicinity 
of the junction. Depending on the nature of the solution, one or more of the reduc¬ 
tion reactions, Equations 17.3 through 17.7, will occur at the surface of the cathode 
material. Figure 17.14 shows galvanic corrosion. 

Again, the galvanic series (Table 17.2) indicates the relative reactivities, in sea¬ 
water, of a number of metals and alloys. When two alloys are coupled in seawater, 
the one lower in the series will experience corrosion. Some of the alloys in the table 
are grouped in brackets. Generally the base metal is the same for these bracketed 
alloys, and there is little danger of corrosion if alloys within a single bracket are 
coupled. It is also worth noting from this series that some alloys are listed twice 
(e.g., nickel and the stainless steels), in both active and passive states.

694 * Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 

The rate of galvanic attack depends on the relative anode-to-cathode surface 
areas that are exposed to the electrolyte, and the rate is related directly to the 
cathode-anode area ratio; that is, for a given cathode area, a smaller anode will cor¬ 
rode more rapidly than a larger one. The reason for this is that corrosion rate de¬ 
pends on current density (Equation 17.24), the current per unit area of corroding 
surface, and not simply the current. Thus, a high current density results for the an¬ 
ode when its area is small relative to that of the cathode. 

A number of measures may be taken to significantly reduce the effects of 
galvanic corrosion. These include the following: 

1. If coupling of dissimilar metals is necessary, choose two that are close 
together in the galvanic series. 

2. Avoid an unfavorable anode-to-cathode surface area ratio; use an anode area 
as large as possible. 

3. Electrically insulate dissimilar metals from each other. 

4. Electrically connect a third, anodic metal to the other two; this is a form of 
cathodic protection, discussed presently.

Crevice Corrosion 

Electrochemical corrosion may also occur as a consequence of concentration dif¬ 
ferences of ions or dissolved gases in the electrolyte solution, and between two re¬ 
gions of the same metal piece. For such a concentration cell, corrosion occurs in the 
locale that has the lower concentration. A good example of this type of corrosion 
occurs in crevices and recesses or under deposits of dirt or corrosion products where 
the solution becomes stagnant and there is localized depletion of dissolved oxygen, 
crevice corrosion Corrosion preferentially occurring at these positions is called crevice corrosion 
(Figure 17.15). The crevice must be wide enough for the solution to penetrate, yet 
narrow enough for stagnancy; usually the width is several thousandths of an inch. 

The proposed mechanism for crevice corrosion is illustrated in Figure 17.16. 
After oxygen has been depleted within the crevice, oxidation of the metal occurs at

this position according to Equation 17.1. Electrons from this electrochemical reac¬ 
tion are conducted through the metal to adjacent external regions, where they are 
consumed by reduction—most probably reaction 17.5. In many aqueous environ¬ 
ments, the solution within the crevice has been found to develop high concentra¬ 
tions of H + and Cl - ions, which are especially corrosive. Many alloys that passivate 
are susceptible to crevice corrosion because protective films are often destroyed by 
the H + and Cl - ions. 

Crevice corrosion may be prevented by using welded instead of riveted or bolted 
joints, using nonabsorbing gaskets when possible, removing accumulated deposits 
frequently, and designing containment vessels to avoid stagnant areas and ensure 
complete drainage. 

Pitting 

pitting Pitting is another form of very localized corrosion attack in which small pits or holes 

form. They ordinarily penetrate from the top of a horizontal surface downward in 
a nearly vertical direction. It is an extremely insidious type of corrosion, often going

undetected and with very little material loss until failure occurs. An example of pit¬ 
ting corrosion is shown in Figure 17.17. 

The mechanism for pitting is probably the same as for crevice corrosion in that 
oxidation occurs within the pit itself, with complementary reduction at the surface. 
It is supposed that gravity causes the pits to grow downward, the solution at the pit 
tip becoming more concentrated and dense as pit growth progresses. A pit may be 
initiated by a localized surface defect such as a scratch or a slight variation in com¬ 
position. In fact, it has been observed that specimens having polished surfaces 
display a greater resistance to pitting corrosion. Stainless steels are somewhat sus¬ 
ceptible to this form of corrosion; however, alloying with about 2% molybdenum 
enhances their resistance significantly.

Is Equation 17.23 equally valid for uniform corrosion and pitting? Why or why not? 

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).\ 



Intergranular Corrosion 

As the name suggests, intergranular corrosion occurs preferentially along grain 
boundaries for some alloys and in specific environments. The net result is that a 
macroscopic specimen disintegrates along its grain boundaries. This type of corro¬ 
sion is especially prevalent in some stainless steels. When heated to temperatures 
between 500 and 800°C (950 and 1450°F) for sufficiently long time periods, these al¬ 
loys become sensitized to intergranular attack. It is believed that this heat treatment 
permits the formation of small precipitate particles of chromium carbide (Cr 23 C 6 ) 
by reaction between the chromium and carbon in the stainless steel. These particles 
form along the grain boundaries, as illustrated in Figure 17.18. Both the chromium 
and the carbon must diffuse to the grain boundaries to form the precipitates, which 
leaves a chromium-depleted zone adjacent to the grain boundary. Consequently, this 
grain boundary region is now highly susceptible to corrosion.

Intergranular corrosion is an especially severe problem in the welding of stain- 
weld decay less steels, when it is often termed weld decay. Figure 17.19 shows this type of in¬ 

tergranular corrosion. 

Stainless steels may be protected from intergranular corrosion by the follow¬ 
ing measures: (1) subjecting the sensitized material to a high-temperature heat treat¬ 
ment in which all the chromium carbide particles are redissolved, (2) lowering the 
carbon content below 0.03 wt% C so that carbide formation is minimal, and (3) al¬ 
loying the stainless steel with another metal such as niobium or titanium, which has 
a greater tendency to form carbides than does chromium so that the Cr remains in 
solid solution. 

Selective Leaching 

selective leaching Selective leaching is found in solid solution alloys and occurs when one element or 
constituent is preferentially removed as a consequence of corrosion processes. The 
most common example is the dezincification of brass, in which zinc is selectively 
leached from a copper-zinc brass alloy. The mechanical properties of the alloy are

significantly impaired, because only a porous mass of copper remains in the region 
that has been dezincified. In addition, the material changes from yellow to a red or 
copper color. Selective leaching may also occur with other alloy systems in which 
aluminum, iron, cobalt, chromium, and other elements are vulnerable to preferen¬ 
tial removal. 

Erosion-Corrosion 

erosion-corrosion Erosion-corrosion arises from the combined action of chemical attack and me¬ 
chanical abrasion or wear as a consequence of fluid motion. Virtually all metal 
alloys, to one degree or another, are susceptible to erosion-corrosion. It is espe¬ 
cially harmful to alloys that passivate by forming a protective surface film; the 
abrasive action may erode away the film, leaving exposed a bare metal surface. 
If the coating is not capable of continuously and rapidly reforming as a protec¬ 
tive barrier, corrosion may be severe. Relatively soft metals such as copper and 
lead are also sensitive to this form of attack. Usually it can be identified by sur¬ 
face grooves and waves having contours that are characteristic of the flow of the 
fluid. 

The nature of the fluid can have a dramatic influence on the corrosion behav¬ 
ior. Increasing fluid velocity normally enhances the rate of corrosion. Also, a solu¬ 
tion is more erosive when bubbles and suspended particulate solids are present. 

Erosion-corrosion is commonly found in piping, especially at bends, elbows, 
and abrupt changes in pipe diameter—positions where the fluid changes direction 
or flow suddenly becomes turbulent. Propellers, turbine blades, valves, and pumps 
are also susceptible to this form of corrosion. Figure 17.20 illustrates the impinge¬ 
ment failure of an elbow fitting. 

One of the best ways to reduce erosion-corrosion is to change the design to 
eliminate fluid turbulence and impingement effects. Other materials may also be 
used that inherently resist erosion. Furthermore, removal of particulates and bub¬ 
bles from the solution will lessen its ability to erode. 

Stress Corrosion 

stress corrosion Stress corrosion, sometimes termed stress corrosion cracking, results from the 

combined action of an applied tensile stress and a corrosive environment; both 
influences are necessary. In fact, some materials that are virtually inert in a particular

corrosive medium become susceptible to this form of corrosion when a stress is 
applied. Small cracks form and then propagate in a direction perpendicular to the 
stress, with the result that failure may eventually occur. Failure behavior is char¬ 
acteristic of that for a brittle material, even though the metal alloy is intrinsically 
ductile. Furthermore, cracks may form at relatively low stress levels, significantly 
below the tensile strength. Most alloys are susceptible to stress corrosion in spe¬ 
cific environments, especially at moderate stress levels. For example, most stain¬ 
less steels stress corrode in solutions containing chloride ions, whereas brasses are 
especially vulnerable when exposed to ammonia. Figure 17.21 is a photomicro¬ 
graph in which an example of intergranular stress corrosion cracking in brass is 
shown. 

The stress that produces stress corrosion cracking need not be externally ap¬ 
plied; it may be a residual one that results from rapid temperature changes and un¬ 
even contraction, or for two-phase alloys in which each phase has a different coef¬ 
ficient of expansion. Also, gaseous and solid corrosion products that are entrapped 
internally can give rise to internal stresses. 

Probably the best measure to take in reducing or totally eliminating stress cor¬ 
rosion is to lower the magnitude of the stress. This may be accomplished by reduc¬ 
ing the external load or increasing the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the ap¬ 
plied stress. Furthermore, an appropriate heat treatment may be used to anneal out 
any residual thermal stresses. 

Hydrogen Embrittlement 

Various metal alloys, specifically some steels, experience a significant reduction in 
ductility and tensile strength when atomic hydrogen (H) penetrates into the mate¬ 
rial. This phenomenon is aptly referred to as hydrogen embrittlement; the terms 





700 * Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 

hydrogen-induced cracking and hydrogen stress cracking are sometimes also used. 
Strictly speaking, hydrogen embrittlement is a type of failure; in response to applied 
or residual tensile stresses, brittle fracture occurs catastrophically as cracks grow 
and rapidly propagate. Hydrogen in its atomic form (H as opposed to the molecu¬ 
lar form, H 2 ) diffuses interstitially through the crystal lattice, and concentrations as 
low as several parts per million can lead to cracking. Furthermore, hydrogen-induced 
cracks are most often transgranular, although intergranular fracture is observed for 
some alloy systems. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain 
hydrogen embrittlement; most of them are based on the interference of dislocation 
motion by the dissolved hydrogen. 

Hydrogen embrittlement is similar to stress corrosion (as discussed in the pre¬ 
ceding section) in that a normally ductile metal experiences brittle fracture when 
exposed to both a tensile stress and a corrosive atmosphere. However, these two 
phenomena may be distinguished on the basis of their interactions with applied 
electric currents. Whereas cathodic protection (Section 17.9) reduces or causes a 
cessation of stress corrosion, it may, on the other hand, lead to the initiation or 
enhancement of hydrogen embrittlement. 

For hydrogen embrittlement to occur, some source of hydrogen must be pres¬ 
ent, and, in addition, the possibility for the formation of its atomic species. Situa¬ 
tions wherein these conditions are met include the following: pickling 3 of steels in 
sulfuric acid; electroplating; and the presence of hydrogen-bearing atmospheres (in¬ 
cluding water vapor) at elevated temperatures such as during welding and heat 
treatments. Also, the presence of what are termed poisons such as sulfur (i.e., H 2 S) 
and arsenic compounds accelerates hydrogen embrittlement; these substances re¬ 
tard the formation of molecular hydrogen and thereby increase the residence time 
of atomic hydrogen on the metal surface. Hydrogen sulfide, probably the most 
aggressive poison, is found in petroleum fluids, natural gas, oil-well brines, and 
geothermal fluids. 

High-strength steels are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement, and increasing 
strength tends to enhance the material’s susceptibility. Martensitic steels are espe¬ 
cially vulnerable to this type of failure; bainitic, ferritic, and spheroiditic steels are 
more resilient. Furthermore, FCC alloys (austenitic stainless steels, and alloys of 
copper, aluminum, and nickel) are relatively resistant to hydrogen embrittlement, 
mainly because of their inherently high ductilities. However, strain hardening these 
alloys will enhance their susceptibility to embrittlement. 

Some of the techniques commonly used to reduce the likelihood of hydrogen 
embrittlement include reducing the tensile strength of the alloy via a heat treat¬ 
ment, removal of the source of hydrogen, “baking” the alloy at an elevated tem¬ 
perature to drive out any dissolved hydrogen, and substitution of a more 
embrittlement-resistant alloy. 

17.8 CORROSION ENVIRONMENTS 

Corrosive environments include the atmosphere, aqueous solutions, soils, acids, bases, 
inorganic solvents, molten salts, liquid metals, and, last but not least, the human body. 
On a tonnage basis, atmospheric corrosion accounts for the greatest losses. Moisture 
containing dissolved oxygen is the primary corrosive agent, but other substances, in¬ 
cluding sulfur compounds and sodium chloride, may also contribute. This is especially 
true of marine atmospheres, which are highly corrosive because of the presence of 


3 Pickling is a procedure used to remove surface oxide scale from steel pieces by dipping 
them in a vat of hot, dilute sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. 



17.9 Corrosion Prevention • 701 


sodium chloride. Dilute sulfuric acid solutions (acid rain) in industrial environments 
can also cause corrosion problems. Metals commonly used for atmospheric applica¬ 
tions include alloys of aluminum and copper, and galvanized steel. 

Water environments can also have a variety of compositions and corrosion char¬ 
acteristics. Freshwater normally contains dissolved oxygen as well as minerals, 
several of which account for hardness. Seawater contains approximately 3.5% salt 
(predominantly sodium chloride), as well as some minerals and organic matter. Sea¬ 
water is generally more corrosive than freshwater, frequently producing pitting and 
crevice corrosion. Cast iron, steel, aluminum, copper, brass, and some stainless steels 
are generally suitable for freshwater use, whereas titanium, brass, some bronzes, 
copper-nickel alloys, and nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloys are highly corro¬ 
sion resistant in seawater. 

Soils have a wide range of compositions and susceptibilities to corrosion. Com¬ 
positional variables include moisture, oxygen, salt content, alkalinity, and acidity, as 
well as the presence of various forms of bacteria. Cast iron and plain carbon steels, 
both with and without protective surface coatings, are found most economical for 
underground structures. 

Because there are so many acids, bases, and organic solvents, no attempt is made 
to discuss these solutions in this text. Good references are available that treat these 
topics in detail. 

17.9 CORROSION PREVENTION 

Some corrosion prevention methods were treated relative to the eight forms of cor¬ 
rosion; however, only the measures specific to each of the various corrosion types 
were discussed. Now, some more general techniques are presented; these include ma¬ 
terial selection, environmental alteration, design, coatings, and cathodic protection. 

Perhaps the most common and easiest way of preventing corrosion is through 
the judicious selection of materials once the corrosion environment has been char¬ 
acterized. Standard corrosion references are helpful in this respect. Here, cost may 
be a significant factor. It is not always economically feasible to employ the mate¬ 
rial that provides the optimum corrosion resistance; sometimes, either another alloy 
and/or some other measure must be used. 

Changing the character of the environment, if possible, may also significantly 
influence corrosion. Lowering the fluid temperature and/or velocity usually pro¬ 
duces a reduction in the rate at which corrosion occurs. Many times increasing or 
decreasing the concentration of some species in the solution will have a positive 
effect; for example, the metal may experience passivation, 
inhibitor Inhibitors are substances that, when added in relatively low concentrations to 

the environment, decrease its corrosiveness. Of course, the specific inhibitor de¬ 
pends both on the alloy and on the corrosive environment. Several mechanisms may 
account for the effectiveness of inhibitors. Some react with and virtually eliminate 
a chemically active species in the solution (such as dissolved oxygen). Other 
inhibitor molecules attach themselves to the corroding surface and interfere with 
either the oxidation or the reduction reaction, or form a very thin protective coating. 
Inhibitors are normally used in closed systems such as automobile radiators and 
steam boilers. 

Several aspects of design consideration have already been discussed, especially 
with regard to galvanic and crevice corrosion and erosion-corrosion. In addition, 
the design should allow for complete drainage in the case of a shutdown, and easy 
washing. Because dissolved oxygen may enhance the corrosivity of many solutions, 
the design should, if possible, include provision for the exclusion of air.

cathodic protection 


Oxidation reaction 
for metal M 


sacrificial anode 


Physical barriers to corrosion are applied on surfaces in the form of films and 
coatings. A large diversity of metallic and nonmetallic coating materials are avail¬ 
able. It is essential that the coating maintain a high degree of surface adhesion, which 
undoubtedly requires some preapplication surface treatment. In most cases, the coat¬ 
ing must be virtually nonreactive in the corrosive environment and resistant to me¬ 
chanical damage that exposes the bare metal to the corrosive environment. All three 
material types—metals, ceramics, and polymers—are used as coatings for metals. 

Cathodic Protection 

One of the most effective means of corrosion prevention is cathodic protection; it 
can be used for all eight different forms of corrosion as discussed earlier and may, 
in some situations, completely stop corrosion. Again, oxidation or corrosion of a 
metal M occurs by the generalized reaction 

M -> M n+ + ne~ (17.1) 

Cathodic protection simply involves supplying, from an external source, electrons 
to the metal to be protected, making it a cathode; the preceding reaction is thus 
forced in the reverse (or reduction) direction. 

One cathodic protection technique employs a galvanic couple: the metal to be 
protected is electrically connected to another metal that is more reactive in the par¬ 
ticular environment. The latter experiences oxidation, and, upon giving up electrons, 
protects the first metal from corrosion. The oxidized metal is often called a sacrifi¬ 
cial anode, and magnesium and zinc are commonly used as such because they lie 
at the anodic end of the galvanic series. This form of galvanic protection, for struc¬ 
tures buried in the ground, is illustrated in Figure 17.22a. 

The process of galvanizing is simply one in which a layer of zinc is applied to the 
surface of steel by hot dipping. In the atmosphere and most aqueous environments, 
zinc is anodic to and will thus cathodically protect the steel if there is any surface 
damage (Figure 17.23). Any corrosion of the zinc coating will proceed at an extremely 
slow rate because the ratio of the anode-to-cathode surface area is quite large. 

For another method of cathodic protection, the source of electrons is an im¬ 
pressed current from an external dc power source, as represented in Figure 11.22b 
for an underground tank. The negative terminal of the power source is connected to 
the structure to be protected. The other terminal is joined to an inert anode (often 
graphite), which is, in this case, buried in the soil; high-conductivity backfill material

Tin cans are made of a steel the inside of which is coated with a thin layer of tin. 
The tin protects the steel from corrosion by food products in the same manner as 
zinc protects steel from atmospheric corrosion. Briefly explain how this cathodic 
protection of tin cans is possible, given that tin is electrochemically less active than 
steel in the galvanic series (Table 17.2).

17.10 OXIDATION 

The discussion of Section 17.2 treated the corrosion of metallic materials in terms 
of electrochemical reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In addition, oxi¬ 
dation of metal alloys is also possible in gaseous atmospheres, normally air, wherein 
an oxide layer or scale forms on the surface of the metal. This phenomenon is fre¬ 
quently termed scaling, tarnishing, or dry corrosion. In this section we will discuss 
possible mechanisms for this type of corrosion, the types of oxide layers that can 
form, and the kinetics of oxide formation. 

Mechanisms 

As with aqueous corrosion, the process of oxide layer formation is an electrochemi¬ 
cal one, which may be expressed, for divalent metal M, by the following reaction: 4 

M + \0 2 -> MO (17.28) 

Furthermore, the preceding reaction consists of oxidation and reduction half¬ 
reactions. The former, with the formation of metal ions,

and takes place at the scale-gas interface. A schematic representation of this

that electrons be conducted to the scale-gas interface, at which point the reduction 
reaction occurs; in addition, M 2+ ions must diffuse away from the metal-scale in¬ 
terface, and/or O 2- ions must diffuse toward this same interface (Figure 17.24). 5 
Thus, the oxide scale serves both as an electrolyte through which ions diffuse and 
as an electrical circuit for the passage of electrons. Furthermore, the scale may pro¬ 
tect the metal from rapid oxidation when it acts as a barrier to ionic diffusion and/or 
electrical conduction; most metal oxides are highly electrically insulative. 

Scale Types 

Rate of oxidation (i.e., the rate of film thickness increase) and the tendency of the 
film to protect the metal from further oxidation are related to the relative volumes 
of the oxide and metal. The ratio of these volumes, termed the Pilling-Bedworth 
ratio, may be determined from the following expression: 6 

P-B ratio = 4^ (17.32) 

^mPo

electrons and ions.

where A 0 is the molecular (or formula) weight of the oxide, A u is the atomic 
weight of the metal, and p G and p M are the oxide and metal densities, respectively. 
For metals having P-B ratios less than unity, the oxide film tends to be porous 
and unprotective because it is insufficient to fully cover the metal surface. If the 
ratio is greater than unity, compressive stresses result in the film as it forms. For 
a ratio greater than 2-3, the oxide coating may crack and flake off, continually 
exposing a fresh and unprotected metal surface. The ideal P-B ratio for the for¬ 
mation of a protective oxide film is unity. Table 17.3 presents P-B ratios for met¬ 
als that form protective coatings and for those that do not. Note from these data 
that protective coatings normally form for metals having P-B ratios between 1 
and 2, whereas nonprotective ones usually result when this ratio is less than 1 or 
greater than about 2. In addition to the P-B ratio, other factors also influence the 
oxidation resistance imparted by the film; these include a high degree of adher¬ 
ence between film and metal, comparable coefficients of thermal expansion for 
metal and oxide, and, for the oxide, a relatively high melting point and good high- 
temperature plasticity. 

Several techniques are available for improving the oxidation resistance of a 
metal. One involves application of a protective surface coating of another material 
that adheres well to the metal and also is itself resistant to oxidation. In some in¬ 
stances, the addition of alloying elements will form a more adherent and protective 
oxide scale by virtue of producing a more favorable Pilling-Bedworth ratio and/or 
improving other scale characteristics. 

Kinetics 

One of the primary concerns relative to metal oxidation is the rate at which the re¬ 
action progresses. Inasmuch as the oxide scale reaction product normally remains 
on the surface, the rate of reaction may be determined by measuring the weight 
gain per unit area as a function of time. 

When the oxide that forms is nonporous and adheres to the metal surface, the 
rate of layer growth is controlled by ionic diffusion. A parabolic relationship exists

between the weight gain per unit area W and the time t as follows: 

W 2 = K x t + K 2 (17.34) 

where K x and K 2 are time-independent constants at a given temperature. This weight 
gain-time behavior is plotted schematically in Figure 17.25. The oxidation of iron, 
copper, and cobalt follows this rate expression. 

In the oxidation of metals for which the scale is porous or flakes off (i.e., for 
P-B ratios less than about 1 or greater than about 2), the oxidation rate expression 
is linear; that is, 


Linear rate

oxidation 


Logarithmic rate

W = K 3 t (17.35) 

where K 3 is a constant. Under these circumstances oxygen is always available for 
reaction with an unprotected metal surface because the oxide does not act as a re¬ 
action barrier. Sodium, potassium, and tantalum oxidize according to this rate ex¬ 
pression and, incidentally, have P-B ratios significantly different from unity (Table 
17.3). Linear growth rate kinetics is also represented in Figure 17.25. 

Still a third reaction rate law has been observed for very thin oxide layers (gen¬ 
erally less than 100 nm) that form at relatively low temperatures. The dependence 
of weight gain on time is logarithmic and takes the form 

W = K 4 log(K 5 t + K 6 ) (17.36) 

Again, the Ks are constants. This oxidation behavior, also shown in Figure 17.25, 
has been observed for aluminum, iron, and copper at near-ambient temperatures. 


Corrosion of Ceramic Materials 


Ceramic materials, being compounds between metallic and nonmetallic elements, 
may be thought of as having already been corroded. Thus, they are exceedingly im¬ 
mune to corrosion by almost all environments, especially at room temperature. 
Corrosion of ceramic materials generally involves simple chemical dissolution, in 
contrast to the electrochemical processes found in metals, as described previously. 






17.11 Swelling and Dissolution * 707 


Ceramic materials are frequently used because of their resistance to corrosion. 
Glass is often used to contain liquids for this reason. Refractory ceramics must not 
only withstand high temperatures and provide thermal insulation but, in many in¬ 
stances, must also resist high-temperature attack by molten metals, salts, slags, and 
glasses. Some of the new technology schemes for converting energy from one form to 
another that is more useful require relatively high temperatures, corrosive atmospheres, 
and pressures above the ambient. Ceramic materials are much better suited to with¬ 
stand most of these environments for reasonable time periods than are metals. 

Degradation of Polymers 

Polymeric materials also experience deterioration by means of environmental inter¬ 
actions. However, an undesirable interaction is specified as degradation rather than 
corrosion because the processes are basically dissimilar. Whereas most metallic cor¬ 
rosion reactions are electrochemical, by contrast, polymeric degradation is physio- 
chemical; that is, it involves physical as well as chemical phenomena. Furthermore, a 
wide variety of reactions and adverse consequences are possible for polymer degra¬ 
dation. Polymers may deteriorate by swelling and dissolution. Covalent bond rupture 
as a result of heat energy, chemical reactions, and radiation is also possible, ordinarily 
with an attendant reduction in mechanical integrity. Because of the chemical com¬ 
plexity of polymers, their degradation mechanisms are not well understood. 

To briefly cite a couple of examples of polymer degradation, polyethylene, if ex¬ 
posed to high temperatures in an oxygen atmosphere, suffers an impairment of its me¬ 
chanical properties by becoming brittle. Also, the utility of poly(vinyl chloride) may 
be limited because this material may become discolored when exposed to high tem¬ 
peratures, although such environments may not affect its mechanical characteristics. 

17.11 SWELLING AND DISSOLUTION 

When polymers are exposed to liquids, the main forms of degradation are swelling 
and dissolution. With swelling, the liquid or solute diffuses into and is absorbed 
within the polymer; the small solute molecules fit into and occupy positions among 
the polymer molecules. Thus the macromolecules are forced apart such that the 
specimen expands or swells. Furthermore, this increase in chain separation results 
in a reduction of the secondary intermolecular bonding forces; as a consequence, 
the material becomes softer and more ductile. The liquid solute also lowers the glass 
transition temperature and, if depressed below the ambient temperature, will cause 
a once-strong material to become rubbery and weak. 

Swelling may be considered a partial dissolution process in which there is only 
limited solubility of the polymer in the solvent. Dissolution, which occurs when the 
polymer is completely soluble, may be thought of as just a continuation of swelling. 
As a rule of thumb, the greater the similarity of chemical structure between the 
solvent and polymer, the greater the likelihood of swelling and/or dissolution. For 
example, many hydrocarbon rubbers readily absorb hydrocarbon liquids such as 
gasoline. The responses of selected polymeric materials to organic solvents are con¬ 
tained in Tables 17.4 and 17.5. 

Swelling and dissolution traits also are affected by temperature as well as char¬ 
acteristics of the molecular structure. In general, increasing molecular weight, in¬ 
creasing degree of crosslinking and crystallinity, and decreasing temperature result 
in a reduction of these deteriorative processes. 

In general, polymers are much more resistant to attack by acidic and alkaline 
solutions than are metals. For example, hydrofluoric acid (HF) will corrode many

From a molecular perspective, explain why increasing crosslinking and crystallinity 
of a polymeric material will enhance its resistance to swelling and dissolution. Would 
you expect crosslinking or crystallinity to have the greater influence? Justify your 
choice. Hint: you may want to consult Sections 14.7 and 14.11. 


[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


BOND RUPTURE 

Polymers may also experience degradation by a process termed scission— the 
severance or rupture of molecular chain bonds. This causes a separation of chain 
segments at the point of scission and a reduction in the molecular weight. As pre¬ 
viously discussed (Chapter 15), several properties of polymeric materials, including 
mechanical strength and resistance to chemical attack, depend on molecular weight. 
Consequently, some of the physical and chemical properties of polymers may be 
adversely affected by this form of degradation. Bond rupture may result from 
exposure to radiation or to heat, and from chemical reaction. 

Radiation Effects 

Certain types of radiation [electron beams, x-rays, /3- and y-rays, and ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation] possess sufficient energy to penetrate a polymer specimen and interact with 
the constituent atoms or their electrons. One such reaction is ionization , in which the 
radiation removes an orbital electron from a specific atom, converting that atom into 
a positively charged ion. As a consequence, one of the covalent bonds associated with 
the specific atom is broken, and there is a rearrangement of atoms or groups of atoms 
at that point. This bond breaking leads to either scission or crosslinking at the ioniza¬ 
tion site, depending on the chemical structure of the polymer and also on the dose of 
radiation. Stabilizers (Section 15.21) may be added to protect polymers from radiation 
damage. In day-to-day use, the greatest radiation damage to polymers is caused by UV 
irradiation. After prolonged exposure, most polymer films become brittle, discolor, 
crack, and fail. For example, camping tents begin to tear, dashboards develop cracks, 
and plastic windows become cloudy. Radiation problems are more severe for some 
applications. Polymers on space vehicles must resist degradation after prolonged 
exposures to cosmic radiation. Similarly, polymers used in nuclear reactors must with¬ 
stand high levels of nuclear radiation. Developing polymeric materials that can 
withstand these extreme environments is a continuing challenge. 

Not all consequences of radiation exposure are deleterious. Crosslinking may 
be induced by irradiation to improve the mechanical behavior and degradation char¬ 
acteristics. For example, y-radiation is used commercially to crosslink polyethylene 
to enhance its resistance to softening and flow at elevated temperatures; indeed, 
this process may be carried out on products that have already been fabricated. 

Chemical Reaction Effects 

Oxygen, ozone, and other substances can cause or accelerate chain scission as a re¬ 
sult of chemical reaction. This effect is especially prevalent in vulcanized rubbers 
that have doubly bonded carbon atoms along the backbone molecular chains and 
that are exposed to ozone (0 3 ), an atmospheric pollutant. One such scission reaction 
may be represented by 

— R — C = C — R' — + 0 3 -> — R — C = 0 + 0 = C — R' — + 0- (17.37)

where the chain is severed at the point of the double bond; R and R' represent groups 
of atoms that are unaffected during the reaction. Ordinarily, if the rubber is in an un¬ 
stressed state, an oxide film will form on the surface, protecting the bulk material from 
any further reaction. However, when these materials are subjected to tensile stresses, 
cracks and crevices form and grow in a direction perpendicular to the stress; eventu¬ 
ally, rupture of the material may occur. This is why the sidewalls on rubber bicycle tires 
develop cracks as they age. Apparently these cracks result from large numbers of 
ozone-induced scissions. Chemical degradation is a particular problem for polymers 
used in areas with high levels of air pollutants such as smog and ozone. The elastomers 
in Table 17.5 are rated as to their resistance to degradation by exposure to ozone. Many 
of these chain scission reactions involve reactive groups termed free radicals . Stabiliz¬ 
ers (Section 15.21) may be added to protect polymers from oxidation. The stabilizers 
either sacrificially react with the ozone to consume it, or they react with and eliminate 
the free radicals before they (the free radicals) can inflict more damage. 


Thermal Effects 


Thermal degradation corresponds to the scission of molecular chains at elevated tem¬ 
peratures; as a consequence, some polymers undergo chemical reactions in which 
gaseous species are produced. These reactions are evidenced by a weight loss of ma¬ 
terial; a polymer’s thermal stability is a measure of its resilience to this decomposi¬ 
tion. Thermal stability is related primarily to the magnitude of the bonding energies 
between the various atomic constituents of the polymer: higher bonding energies re¬ 
sult in more thermally stable materials. For example, the magnitude of the C—F bond 
is greater than that of the C—H bond, which in turn is greater than that of the C—Cl 
bond. The fluorocarbons, having C—F bonds, are among the most thermally resistant 
polymeric materials and may be used at relatively high temperatures. However, 
because of the weak C—Cl bond, when poly (vinyl chloride) is heated to 200°C for 
even a few minutes it will discolor and give off large amounts of HC1 that accelerates 
continued decomposition. Stabilizers (Section 15.21) such as ZnO can react with the 
HC1, providing increased thermal stability for poly (vinyl chloride). 

Some of the most thermally stable polymers are the ladder polymers. 7 For ex¬ 
ample, the ladder polymer having the following structure

is so thermally stable that a woven cloth of this material can be heated directly in 
an open flame with no degradation. Polymers of this type are used in place of as¬ 
bestos for high-temperature gloves. 

17.13 WEATHERING 

Many polymeric materials serve in applications that require exposure to outdoor 
conditions. Any resultant degradation is termed weathering, which may be a com¬ 
bination of several different processes. Under these conditions deterioration is pri-

marily a result of oxidation, which is initiated by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
Some polymers such as nylon and cellulose are also susceptible to water absorption, 
which produces a reduction in their hardness and stiffness. Resistance to weather¬ 
ing among the various polymers is quite diverse. The fluorocarbons are virtually in¬ 
ert under these conditions; but some materials, including poly(vinyl chloride) and 
polystyrene, are susceptible to weathering.

SUMMARY 


Electrochemical Considerations 

• Metallic corrosion is ordinarily electrochemical, involving both oxidation and 
reduction reactions. 

Oxidation is the loss of the metal atom’s valence electrons and occurs at the 
anode; the resulting metal ions may either go into the corroding solution 
or form an insoluble compound. 

During reduction (which occurs at the cathode), these electrons are transferred 
to at least one other chemical species. The character of the corrosion envi¬ 
ronment dictates which of several possible reduction reactions will occur. 

• Not all metals oxidize with the same degree of ease, which is demonstrated with 
a galvanic couple. 

When in an electrolyte, one metal (the anode) will corrode, whereas a 
reduction reaction will occur at the other metal (the cathode). 

The magnitude of the electric potential that is established between anode 
and cathode is indicative of the driving force for the corrosion reaction. 

• The standard emf and galvanic series are simply rankings of metallic materials 
on the basis of their tendency to corrode when coupled to other metals. 

For the standard emf series, ranking is based on the magnitude of the volt 
age generated when the standard cell of a metal is coupled to the standard 
hydrogen electrode at 25°C (77°F). 

The galvanic series consists of the relative reactivities of metals and alloys in 
seawater. 

• The half-cell potentials in the standard emf series are thermodynamic parame¬ 
ters that are valid only at equilibrium; corroding systems are not in equilibrium. 
Furthermore, the magnitudes of these potentials provide no indication as to the 
rates at which corrosion reactions occur. 

Corrosion Rates 

• The rate of corrosion may be expressed as corrosion penetration rate, that is, the 
thickness loss of material per unit of time; CPR may be determined using Equa¬ 
tion 17.23. Mils per year and millimeters per year are the common units for this 
parameter. 






712 * Chapter 17 / Corrosion and Degradation of Materials 

• Alternatively, rate is proportional to the current density associated with the 
electrochemical reaction, according to Equation 17.24. 

Prediction of Corrosion Rates 

• Corroding systems will experience polarization, which is the displacement of each 
electrode potential from its equilibrium value; the magnitude of the displacement 
is termed the overvoltage. 

• The corrosion rate of a reaction is limited by polarization, of which there are two 
types—activation and concentration. 

Activation polarization relates to systems in which the corrosion rate is 
determined by the one step in a series that occurs most slowly. For activation 
polarization, a plot of overvoltage versus logarithm of current density will 
appear as shown in Figure 17.7. 

Concentration polarization prevails when the corrosion rate is limited by 
diffusion in the solution. When overvoltage versus the logarithm of current 
density is plotted, the resulting curve will appear as that presented in 
Figure 17.9a. 

• The corrosion rate for a particular reaction may be computed using Equation 17.24, 
incorporating the current density associated with the intersection point of oxida¬ 
tion and reduction polarization curves. 

Passivity 

• A number of metals and alloys passivate, or lose their chemical reactivity, under 
some environmental circumstances. This phenomenon is thought to involve the 
formation of a thin protective oxide film. Stainless steels and aluminum alloys 
exhibit this type of behavior. 

• The active-to-passive behavior may be explained by the alloy’s S-shaped 
electrochemical-potential-versus-log-current-density curve (Figure 17.12). Inter¬ 
sections with reduction polarization curves in active and passive regions corre¬ 
spond, respectively, to high and low corrosion rates (Figure 17.13). 

Forms of Corrosion 

• Metallic corrosion is sometimes classified into eight different forms: 

Uniform attack—degree of corrosion is approximately uniform over the 
entire exposed surface. 

Galvanic corrosion—occurs when two different metals or alloys are electri¬ 
cally coupled while exposed to an electrolyte solution. 

Crevice corrosion—the situation when corrosion occurs under crevices or 
other areas where there is localized depletion of oxygen. 

Pitting—also a type of localized corrosion in which pits or holes form from 
the top of horizontal surfaces. 

Intergranular corrosion—occurs preferentially along grain boundaries for 
specific metals/alloys (e.g., some stainless steels). 

Selective leaching—the case wherein one element/constituent of an alloy is 
removed selectively by corrosive action. 

Erosion-corrosion—the combined action of chemical attack and mechanical 
wear as a consequence of fluid motion. 

Stress corrosion—the formation and propagation of cracks (and possible 
failure) resulting from the combined effects of corrosion and the application 
of a tensile stress. 

Hydrogen embrittlement—a significant reduction in ductility that accompanies 
the penetration of atomic hydrogen into a metal/alloy. 


Summary • 713 


Corrosion Prevention 

• Several measures may be taken to prevent, or at least reduce, corrosion. These 
include material selection, environmental alteration, the use of inhibitors, design 
changes, application of coatings, and cathodic protection. 

• With cathodic protection, the metal to be protected is made a cathode by sup¬ 
plying electrons from an external source. 

Oxidation 

• Oxidation of metallic materials by electrochemical action is also possible in dry, 
gaseous atmospheres (Figure 17.24). 

• An oxide film forms on the surface that may act as a barrier to further oxidation 
if the volumes of metal and oxide film are similar, that is, if the Pilling-Bedworth 
ratio (Equations 17.32 and 17.33) is near unity. 

• The kinetics of film formation may follow parabolic (Equation 17.34), linear 
(Equation 17.35), or logarithmic (Equation 17.36) rate laws. 

Corrosion of Ceramic Materials 

• Ceramic materials, being inherently corrosion resistant, are frequently used at el¬ 
evated temperatures and/or in extremely corrosive environments. 

Degradation of Polymers 

• Polymeric materials deteriorate by noncorrosive processes. Upon exposure to liq¬ 
uids, they may experience degradation by swelling or dissolution. 

With swelling, solute molecules actually fit into the molecular structure. 

Dissolution may occur when the polymer is completely soluble in the liquid. 

• Scission, or the severance of molecular chain bonds, may be induced by radia¬ 
tion, chemical reactions, or heat. This results in a reduction of molecular weight 
and a deterioration of the physical and chemical properties of the polymer.

WHY STUDY the Electrical Properties of Materials? 


Consideration of the electrical properties of materials 
is often important when materials selection and pro¬ 
cessing decisions are being made during the design of 
a component or structure. For example, when we 
consider an integrated circuit package, the electrical 
behaviors of the various materials are diverse. Some need 
to be highly electrically conductive (e.g., connecting 
wires), whereas electrical insulativity is required of 
others (e.g., the protective package encapsulation). 

In the processing/structure/properties/performance 
scheme for silicon semiconductors, reasons for studying 
the electrical properties of materials are as follows: 

• The electrical properties of semiconductors (e.g., 
silicon) are dependent on their electron band 


structures—namely, electron energy states that are 
occupied by electrons that are available to participate 
in the conduction process. In this chapter we 
introduce the concept of electrical conduction for 
semiconductors from the perspective of their band 
structures. 

• We also discuss how the addition of atoms of specific 
elements in minute concentrations affects the band 
structure, and, in turn, the electrical characteristics 
of a semiconductor. 

• The electrical characteristics and mechanics of 
operation of two different semiconducting devices 
that are employed in integrated circuits are also 
described and explained. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Describe the four possible electron band struc¬ 
tures for solid materials. 

2. Briefly describe electron excitation events that 
produce free electrons/holes in (a) metals, 

(b) semiconductors (intrinsic and extrinsic), 
and (c) insulators. 

3. Calculate the electrical conductivities of 
metals, semiconductors (intrinsic and extrinsic), 
and insulators given their charge carrier 
density(s) and mobility(s). 

4. Distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic 
semiconducting materials. 

5. (a) On a plot of logarithm of carrier (electron, 

hole) concentration versus absolute tem¬ 
perature, draw schematic curves for both 
intrinsic and extrinsic semiconducting 
materials. 


(b) On the extrinsic curve, note freeze-out, 
extrinsic, and intrinsic regions. 

6. For a p-n junction, explain the rectification 
process in terms of electron and hole motions. 

7 Calculate the capacitance of a parallel-plate 
capacitor. 

8. Define dielectric constant in terms of permit¬ 
tivities. 

9. Briefly explain how the charge storing capacity 
of a capacitor may be increased by the 
insertion and polarization of a dielectric 
material between its plates. 

10. Name and describe the three types of 
polarization. 

11. Briefly describe the phenomena of ferroelec- 
tricity and piezoelectricity. 


18.1 INTRODUCTION 

The prime objective of this chapter is to explore the electrical properties of materials, 
that is, their responses to an applied electric field. We begin with the phenomenon 
of electrical conduction: the parameters by which it is expressed, the mechanism of 
conduction by electrons, and how the electron energy band structure of a material 
influences its ability to conduct. These principles are extended to metals, semicon¬ 
ductors, and insulators. Particular attention is given to the characteristics of semi¬ 
conductors and then to semiconducting devices. Also treated are the dielectric 
characteristics of insulating materials. The final sections are devoted to the pecu¬ 
liar phenomena of ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity.

18.2 OHM'S LAW 

One of the most important electrical characteristics of a solid material is the ease 
Ohm’s law with which it transmits an electric current. Ohm’s law relates the current I —or time 

rate of charge passage—to the applied voltage V as follows:

where R is the resistance of the material through which the current is passing. The 
units for V, /, and R are, respectively, volts (J/C), amperes (C/s), and ohms (V/A). 
The value of R is influenced by specimen configuration, and for many materials is 
independent of current. The electrical resistivity p is independent of specimen geom¬ 
etry but related to R through the expression 


P = 


RA 

~T 


(18.2) 


where / is the distance between the two points at which the voltage is measured and 
A is the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of the current. The units 
for p are ohm-meters (II *m). From the expression for Ohm’s law and Equation 18.2, 


P =

electrical conductivity Sometimes, electrical conductivity cr is used to specify the electrical character of a 
material. It is simply the reciprocal of the resistivity, or

and resistivity

/ Electrical Properties 

and is indicative of the ease with which a material is capable of conducting an elec¬ 
tric current. The units for cr are reciprocal ohm-meters [(H • m) _1 , or mho/m]. The 
following discussions on electrical properties use both resistivity and conductivity. 
In addition to Equation 18.1, Ohm’s law may be expressed as 

J = c j% (18.5) 

in which J is the current density, the current per unit of specimen area IIA, and % 
is the electric field intensity, or the voltage difference between two points divided 
by the distance separating them; that is, 

% = y ( 18 . 6 ) 

The demonstration of the equivalence of the two Ohm’s law expressions (Equa¬ 
tions 18.1 and 18.5) is left as a homework exercise. 

Solid materials exhibit an amazing range of electrical conductivities, extending 
over 27 orders of magnitude; probably no other physical property experiences this 
breadth of variation. In fact, one way of classifying solid materials is according to the 
ease with which they conduct an electric current; within this classification scheme there 
are three groupings: conductors ; semiconductors, and insulators. Metals are good con¬ 
ductors, typically having conductivities on the order of 10 7 (11 • m) -1 . At the other ex¬ 
treme are materials with very low conductivities, ranging between 10“ 10 and 10 -20 
(11 • m) -1 ; these are electrical insulators. Materials with intermediate conductivities, gen¬ 
erally from 1CT 6 to 10 4 (H • m) -1 , are termed semiconductors. Electrical conductivity 
ranges for the various material types are compared in the bar chart of Figure 1.7. 

18.4 ELECTRONIC AND IONIC CONDUCTION 

An electric current results from the motion of electrically charged particles in re¬ 
sponse to forces that act on them from an externally applied electric field. Posi¬ 
tively charged particles are accelerated in the field direction, negatively charged 
particles in the direction opposite. Within most solid materials a current arises from 
the flow of electrons, which is termed electronic conduction. In addition, for ionic 
materials a net motion of charged ions is possible that produces a current; such is 
ionic conduction termed ionic conduction. The present discussion deals with electronic conduction; 

ionic conduction is treated briefly in Section 18.16. 

18.5 ENERGY BAND STRUCTURES IN SOLIDS 

In all conductors, semiconductors, and many insulating materials, only electronic 
conduction exists, and the magnitude of the electrical conductivity is strongly de¬ 
pendent on the number of electrons available to participate in the conduction 
process. However, not all electrons in every atom will accelerate in the presence of 
an electric field. The number of electrons available for electrical conduction in a 
particular material is related to the arrangement of electron states or levels with 
respect to energy, and then the manner in which these states are occupied by elec¬ 
trons. A thorough exploration of these topics is complicated and involves principles 
of quantum mechanics that are beyond the scope of this book; the ensuing devel¬ 
opment omits some concepts and simplifies others. 

Concepts relating to electron energy states, their occupancy, and the resulting elec¬ 
tron configuration for isolated atoms were discussed in Section 2.3. By way of review, 
for each individual atom there exist discrete energy levels that may be occupied by elec¬ 
trons, arranged into shells and subshells. Shells are designated by integers (1,2,3, etc.),

Interatomic separation 


and subshells by letters (v, p , d, and /). For each of s, p , d , and / subshells, there exist, 
respectively, one, three, five, and seven states. The electrons in most atoms fill only the 
states having the lowest energies, two electrons of opposite spin per state, in accor¬ 
dance with the Pauli exclusion principle. The electron configuration of an isolated atom 
represents the arrangement of the electrons within the allowed states. 

Let us now make an extrapolation of some of these concepts to solid materi¬ 
als. A solid may be thought of as consisting of a large number, say, N , of atoms ini¬ 
tially separated from one another, which are subsequently brought together and 
bonded to form the ordered atomic arrangement found in the crystalline material. 
At relatively large separation distances, each atom is independent of all the others 
and will have the atomic energy levels and electron configuration as if isolated. 
However, as the atoms come within close proximity of one another, electrons are 
acted upon, or perturbed, by the electrons and nuclei of adjacent atoms. This in¬ 
fluence is such that each distinct atomic state may split into a series of closely spaced 
electron states in the solid, to form what is termed an electron energy band. The 
extent of splitting depends on interatomic separation (Figure 18.2) and begins with 
the outermost electron shells, because they are the first to be perturbed as the atoms 
coalesce. Within each band, the energy states are discrete, yet the difference be¬ 
tween adjacent states is exceedingly small. At the equilibrium spacing, band for¬ 
mation may not occur for the electron subshells nearest the nucleus, as illustrated 
in Figure 18.3 b. Furthermore, gaps may exist between adjacent bands, as also indi¬ 
cated in the figure; normally, energies lying within these band gaps are not avail¬ 
able for electron occupancy. The conventional way of representing electron band 
structures in solids is shown in Figure 18.3a. 

The number of states within each band will equal the total of all states con¬ 
tributed by the N atoms. For example, an v band will consist of N states, and a p band 
of 3 N states. With regard to occupancy, each energy state may accommodate two 
electrons, which must have oppositely directed spins. Furthermore, bands will con¬ 
tain the electrons that resided in the corresponding levels of the isolated atoms; for 
example, a 4s energy band in the solid will contain those isolated atoms’ 4s electrons. 
Of course, there will be empty bands and, possibly, bands that are only partially filled. 

The electrical properties of a solid material are a consequence of its electron 
band structure—that is, the arrangement of the outermost electron bands and the 
way in which they are filled with electrons. 

Four different types of band structures are possible at 0 K. In the first (Figure 18.4a), 
one outermost band is only partially filled with electrons. The energy corresponding

to the highest filled state at 0 K is called the Fermi energy Ep as indicated. This en¬ 
ergy band structure is typified by some metals, in particular those that have a single 
s valence electron (e.g., copper). Each copper atom has one 4s electron; however, 
for a solid composed of N atoms, the 4s band is capable of accommodating 2N elec¬ 
trons. Thus only half the available electron positions within this 4s band are filled. 

For the second band structure, also found in metals (Figure ISAb), there is an 
overlap of an empty band and a filled band. Magnesium has this band structure.

18.6 Conduction in Terms of Band and Atomic Bonding Models * 725 


Each isolated Mg atom has two 3s electrons. However, when a solid is formed, the 
3s and 3 p bands overlap. In this instance and at 0 K, the Fermi energy is taken as 
that energy below which, for N atoms, N states are filled, two electrons per state. 

The final two band structures are similar; one band (the valence band) that is 
completely filled with electrons is separated from an empty conduction band, and 
an energy band gap lies between them. For very pure materials, electrons may not 
have energies within this gap. The difference between the two band structures lies 
in the magnitude of the energy gap; for materials that are insulators, the band gap 
is relatively wide (Figure 18.4c), whereas for semiconductors it is narrow (Fig¬ 
ure 18.4J). The Fermi energy for these two band structures lies within the band 
gap—near its center. 

18.6 CONDUCTION IN TERMS OF BAND AND 
ATOMIC BONDING MODELS 

At this point in the discussion, it is vital that another concept be understood — 
namely, that only electrons with energies greater than the Fermi energy may be 
acted on and accelerated in the presence of an electric field. These are the electrons 
free electron that participate in the conduction process, which are termed free electrons. Another 

charged electronic entity called a hole is found in semiconductors and insulators. 
Holes have energies less than Ef and also participate in electronic conduction. As 
the ensuing discussion reveals, the electrical conductivity is a direct function of the 
numbers of free electrons and holes. In addition, the distinction between conduc¬ 
tors and nonconductors (insulators and semiconductors) lies in the numbers of these 
free electron and hole charge carriers. 

Metals 

For an electron to become free, it must be excited or promoted into one of the 
empty and available energy states above E f . For metals having either of the band 
structures shown in Figures 18.4a and 18.4Z), there are vacant energy states adjacent 
to the highest filled state at E f . Thus, very little energy is required to promote elec¬ 
trons into the low-lying empty states, as shown in Figure 18.5. Generally, the energy 
provided by an electric field is sufficient to excite large numbers of electrons into 
these conducting states. 

For the metallic bonding model discussed in Section 2.6, it was assumed that 
all the valence electrons have freedom of motion and form an electron gas , which 
is uniformly distributed throughout the lattice of ion cores. Although these elec¬ 
trons are not locally bound to any particular atom, nevertheless, they must experi¬ 
ence some excitation to become conducting electrons that are truly free. Thus,

although only a fraction are excited, this still gives rise to a relatively large number 
of free electrons and, consequently, a high conductivity. 

Insulators and Semiconductors 

For insulators and semiconductors, empty states adjacent to the top of the filled va¬ 
lence band are not available. To become free, therefore, electrons must be promoted 
across the energy band gap and into empty states at the bottom of the conduction 
band. This is possible only by supplying to an electron the difference in energy be¬ 
tween these two states, which is approximately equal to the band gap energy E g . 
This excitation process is demonstrated in Figure 18.6. 1 For many materials this 
band gap is several electron volts wide. Most often the excitation energy is from a 
nonelectrical source such as heat or light, usually the former. 

The number of electrons excited thermally (by heat energy) into the conduc¬ 
tion band depends on the energy band gap width as well as temperature. At a given 
temperature, the larger the E g , the lower the probability that a valence electron will 
be promoted into an energy state within the conduction band; this results in fewer 
conduction electrons. In other words, the larger the band gap, the lower the elec¬ 
trical conductivity at a given temperature. Thus, the distinction between semicon¬ 
ductors and insulators lies in the width of the band gap; for semiconductors it is 
narrow, whereas for insulating materials it is relatively wide. 

Increasing the temperature of either a semiconductor or an insulator results in 
an increase in the thermal energy that is available for electron excitation. Thus, more 
electrons are promoted into the conduction band, which gives rise to an enhanced 
conductivity. 

The conductivity of insulators and semiconductors may also be viewed from the 
perspective of atomic bonding models discussed in Section 2.6. For electrically in¬ 
sulating materials, interatomic bonding is ionic or strongly covalent. Thus, the va¬ 
lence electrons are tightly bound to or shared with the individual atoms. In other 
words, these electrons are highly localized and are not in any sense free to wander 
throughout the crystal. The bonding in semiconductors is covalent (or predominantly 


1 The magnitudes of the band gap energy and the energies between adjacent levels in both 
the valence and conduction bands of Figure 18.6 are not to scale. Whereas the band gap 
energy is on the order of an electron volt, these levels are separated by energies on the 
order of 1CT 10 eV.

strongly bound to the atoms. Consequently, these electrons are more easily removed 
by thermal excitation than they are for insulators.

When an electric field is applied, a force is brought to bear on the free electrons; 
as a consequence, they all experience an acceleration in a direction opposite to 
that of the field, by virtue of their negative charge. According to quantum me¬ 
chanics, there is no interaction between an accelerating electron and atoms in a 
perfect crystal lattice. Under such circumstances all the free electrons should ac¬ 
celerate as long as the electric field is applied, which would give rise to an electric 
current that is continuously increasing with time. However, we know that a cur¬ 
rent reaches a constant value the instant that a field is applied, indicating that there 
exist what might be termed frictional forces, which counter this acceleration from 
the external field. These frictional forces result from the scattering of electrons by 
imperfections in the crystal lattice, including impurity atoms, vacancies, interstitial 
atoms, dislocations, and even the thermal vibrations of the atoms themselves. Each 
scattering event causes an electron to lose kinetic energy and to change its direc¬ 
tion of motion, as represented schematically in Figure 18.7. There is, however, some 
net electron motion in the direction opposite to the field, and this flow of charge 
is the electric current. 

The scattering phenomenon is manifested as a resistance to the passage of an 
electric current. Several parameters are used to describe the extent of this scatter¬ 
ing; these include the drift velocity and the mobility of an electron. The drift veloc¬ 
ity v d represents the average electron velocity in the direction of the force imposed 
by the applied field. It is directly proportional to the electric field as follows: 

^ (18.7) 

The constant of proportionality i± e is called the electron mobility, which is an indi¬ 
cation of the frequency of scattering events; its units are square meters per volt- 
second (m 2 /V*s). 

The conductivity a of most materials may be expressed as 

a = n\e\iL e (18.8)

where n is the number of free or conducting electrons per unit volume (e.g., per 
cubic meter) and \e\ is the absolute magnitude of the electrical charge on an electron 
(1.6 X 1CT 19 C). Thus, the electrical conductivity is proportional to both the num¬ 
ber of free electrons and the electron mobility.

If a metallic material is cooled through its melting temperature at an extremely 
rapid rate, it will form a noncrystalline solid (i.e., a metallic glass). Will the electri¬ 
cal conductivity of the noncrystalline metal be greater or less than its crystalline 
counterpart? Why?

18.8 ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY OF METALS 

As mentioned previously, most metals are extremely good conductors of electric¬ 
ity; room-temperature conductivities for several of the more common metals are 
contained in Table 18.1. (Table B.9 in Appendix B lists the electrical resistivities of 
a large number of metals and alloys.) Again, metals have high conductivities be¬ 
cause of the large numbers of free electrons that have been excited into empty states 
above the Fermi energy. Thus n has a large value in the conductivity expression, 
Equation 18.8. 

At this point it is convenient to discuss conduction in metals in terms of the re¬ 
sistivity, the reciprocal of conductivity; the reason for this switch should become ap¬ 
parent in the ensuing discussion. 

Because crystalline defects serve as scattering centers for conduction electrons 
in metals, increasing their number raises the resistivity (or lowers the conductiv¬ 
ity). The concentration of these imperfections depends on temperature, composi¬ 
tion, and the degree of cold work of a metal specimen. In fact, it has been observed 
experimentally that the total resistivity of a metal is the sum of the contributions 
from thermal vibrations, impurities, and plastic deformation; that is, the scattering

in which p t , p h and p d represent the individual thermal, impurity, and deformation 
resistivity contributions, respectively. Equation 18.9 is sometimes known as 
Matthiessen’s rule. The influence of each p variable on the total resistivity is demon¬ 
strated in Figure 18.8, a plot of resistivity versus temperature for copper and sev¬

electron-scattering centers.

where A is a composition-independent constant that is a function of both the im¬

temperature resistivity of copper is demonstrated in Figure 18.9, up to 50 wt% Ni; 
over this composition range nickel is completely soluble in copper (Figure 9.3a). 
Again, nickel atoms in copper act as scattering centers, and increasing the concen¬ 
tration of nickel in copper results in an enhancement of resistivity. 

For a two-phase alloy consisting of a and /3 phases, a rule-of-mixtures expression 
may be used to approximate the resistivity as follows: 

Pi = PcXa + PpVp (18.12) 

where the Vs and ps represent volume fractions and individual resistivities for the 
respective phases. 


Influence of Plastic Deformation 

Plastic deformation also raises the electrical resistivity as a result of increased num¬ 
bers of electron-scattering dislocations. The effect of deformation on resistivity is 
also represented in Figure 18.8. Furthermore, its influence is much weaker than that 
of increasing temperature or the presence of impurities.

18.9 Electrical Characteristics of Commercial Alloys * 731 


18.9 ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF 
COMMERCIAL ALLOYS 

Electrical and other properties of copper render it the most widely used metallic 
conductor. Oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper, having extremely low 
oxygen and other impurity contents, is produced for many electrical applications. 
Aluminum, having a conductivity only about one-half that of copper, is also fre¬ 
quently used as an electrical conductor. Silver has a higher conductivity than either 
copper or aluminum; however, its use is restricted on the basis of cost. 

On occasion, it is necessary to improve the mechanical strength of a metal alloy 
without impairing significantly its electrical conductivity. Both solid-solution alloy¬ 
ing (Section 7.9) and cold working (Section 7.10) improve strength at the expense 
of conductivity, and thus, a trade-off must be made for these two properties. Most 
often, strength is enhanced by introducing a second phase that does not have so ad¬ 
verse an effect on conductivity. For example, copper-beryllium alloys are precipi¬ 
tation hardened (Section 11.9); but even so, the conductivity is reduced by about a 
factor of 5 over high-purity copper. 

For some applications, such as furnace heating elements, a high electrical resis¬ 
tivity is desirable. The energy loss by electrons that are scattered is dissipated as heat 
energy. Such materials must have not only a high resistivity, but also a resistance to 
oxidation at elevated temperatures and, of course, a high melting temperature. 
Nichrome, a nickel-chromium alloy, is commonly employed in heating elements. 


MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Aluminum Electrical Wires 


C opper is normally used for electrical wiring in 
residential and commercial buildings. How¬ 
ever, between 1965 and 1973 the price of copper 
increased significantly, and, consequently alu¬ 
minum wiring was installed in many buildings con¬ 
structed or remodeled during this period because 
aluminum was a less expensive electrical conduc¬ 
tor. An inordinately high number of fires occurred 
in these buildings, and investigations revealed that 
the use of aluminum posed an increased fire haz¬ 
ard risk over copper wiring. 

When properly installed, aluminum wiring can 
be just as safe as copper. These safety problems 
arose at connection points between the aluminum 
and copper; copper wiring was used for connec¬ 
tion terminals on electrical equipment (circuit 
breakers, receptacles, switches, etc.) to which the 
aluminum wiring was attached. 

As electrical circuits are turned on and off, the 
electrical wiring heats up and then cools down. 
This thermal cycling causes the wires to alternately 
expand and contract. The amounts of expansion 


and contraction for the aluminum are greater than 
for copper—aluminum has a higher coefficient of 
thermal expansion than copper (Section 19.3). 2 
Consequently, these differences in expansion and 
contraction between the aluminum and copper 
wires can cause the connections to loosen. An¬ 
other factor that contributes to the loosening of 
copper-aluminum wire connections is creep (Sec¬ 
tion 8.12); mechanical stresses exist at these wire 
connections, and aluminum is more susceptible to 
creep deformation at or near room temperature 
than copper. This loosening of the connections 
compromises the electrical wire-to-wire contact, 
which increases the electrical resistance at the con¬ 
nection and leads to increased heating. Aluminum 
oxidizes more readily than copper, and this oxide 
coating further increases the electrical resistance 
at the connection. Ultimately, a connection may 
deteriorate to the point that electrical arcing 
and/or heat buildup can ignite any combustible 
materials in the vicinity of the junction. Inasmuch 
as most receptacles, switches, and other connections

copper alloys used for electrical wiring, are presented in Table 18.2.

fire may spread undetected for an extended pe¬

Warning signs that suggest possible connection 
problems include warm faceplates on switches or 
receptacles, the smell of burning plastic in the vicin¬ 
ity of outlets or switches, lights that flicker or burn 
out quickly, unusual static on radio/television, and 
circuit breakers that trip for no apparent reason. 

Several options are available for making 
buildings wired with aluminum safe. 3 The most 
obvious (and also most expensive) is to replace all 
of the aluminum wires with copper. The next best 
option is the installation of a crimp connector repair 
unit at each aluminum-copper connection. With 
this technique, a piece of copper wire is attached 
to the existing aluminum wire branch using a spe¬ 
cially designed metal sleeve and powered crimp¬ 
ing tool; the metal sleeve is called a “COPALUM 
parallel splice connector.” The crimping tool

Two other less-desirable options are CO/ALR 
devices and pigtailing. A CO/ALR device is simply 
a switch or wall receptacle that is designed to be 
used with aluminum wiring. For pigtailing, a twist- 
on connecting wire nut is used, which employs a 
grease that inhibits corrosion while maintaining a 
high electrical conductivity at the junction.

18.10 Intrinsic Semiconduction * 733 


Semiconductivity 

The electrical conductivity of the semiconducting materials is not as high as that of 
the metals; nevertheless, they have some unique electrical characteristics that render 
them especially useful. The electrical properties of these materials are extremely 
intrinsic sensitive to the presence of even minute concentrations of impurities. Intrinsic semi- 

semiconductor conductors are those in which the electrical behavior is based on the electronic 

structure inherent in the pure material. When the electrical characteristics are 
extrinsic dictated by impurity atoms, the semiconductor is said to be extrinsic, 

semiconductor 

18.10 INTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTION 

Intrinsic semiconductors are characterized by the electron band structure shown in 
Figure 18.4d: at 0 K, a completely filled valence band, separated from an empty con¬ 
duction band by a relatively narrow forbidden band gap, generally less than 2 eV. 
The two elemental semiconductors are silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), having 
band gap energies of approximately 1.1 and 0.7 eV, respectively. Both are found in 
Group IVA of the periodic table (Figure 2.6) and are covalently bonded. * * * 4 In addi¬ 
tion, a host of compound semiconducting materials also display intrinsic behavior. 
One such group is formed between elements of Groups IIIA and VA, for example, 
gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium antimonide (InSb); these are frequently called 
III-V compounds. The compounds composed of elements of Groups IIB and VIA 
also display semiconducting behavior; these include cadmium sulfide (CdS) and zinc 
telluride (ZnTe). As the two elements forming these compounds become more 
widely separated with respect to their relative positions in the periodic table (i.e., 
the electronegativities become more dissimilar, Figure 2.7), the atomic bonding 
becomes more ionic and the magnitude of the band gap energy increases—the 
materials tend to become more insulative. Table 18.3 gives the band gaps for some 
compound semiconductors.

Concept of a Hole 

In intrinsic semiconductors, for every electron excited into the conduction band 

there is left behind a missing electron in one of the covalent bonds, or in the band 
scheme, a vacant electron state in the valence band, as shown in Figure 18.6Z?. 5 Under 


4 The valence bands in silicon and germanium correspond to sp 3 hybrid energy levels for 
the isolated atom; these hybridized valence bands are completely filled at 0 K. 

5 Holes (in addition to free electrons) are created in semiconductors and insulators when 
electron transitions occur from filled states in the valence band to empty states in the con¬ 
duction band (Figure 18.6). In metals, electron transitions normally occur from empty to 
filled states within the same band (Figure 18.5), without the creation of holes.

the influence of an electric field, the position of this missing electron within the 
crystalline lattice may be thought of as moving by the motion of other valence elec¬ 
trons that repeatedly fill in the incomplete bond (Figure 18.11). This process is ex¬ 
pedited by treating a missing electron from the valence band as a positively charged 
particle called a hole . A hole is considered to have a charge that is of the same mag¬ 
nitude as that for an electron, but of opposite sign ( + 1.6 X 10 -19 C). Thus, in the 
presence of an electric field, excited electrons and holes move in opposite direc¬ 
tions. Furthermore, in semiconductors both electrons and holes are scattered by lat¬ 
tice imperfections. 

Intrinsic Conductivity 

Because there are two types of charge carrier (free electrons and holes) in an in¬ 
trinsic semiconductor, the expression for electrical conduction, Equation 18.8, must 
be modified to include a term to account for the contribution of the hole current. 
Therefore, we write 


a = n\e\fi e + p\e\fi h 


(18.13) 


where p is the number of holes per cubic meter and p h is the hole mobility. The 
magnitude of p h is always less than p, e for semiconductors. For intrinsic semicon¬ 
ductors, every electron promoted across the band gap leaves behind a hole in the 
valence band; thus, 

n = p = n L (18.14) 

where n t is known as the intrinsic carrier concentration. Furthermore, 


a = n\e\(p, e + fi h ) = p\e\(p, e + p h ) 
= rii\e\(fi e + fi h ) 


(18.15) 


The room-temperature intrinsic conductivities and electron and hole mobilities for 
several semiconducting materials are also presented in Table 18.3.

Computation of the Room-Temperature Intrinsic Carrier

For intrinsic gallium arsenide, the room-temperature electrical conductivity is

m 2 /V*s. Compute the intrinsic carrier concentration n, at room temperature.

18.11 EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTION 

Virtually all commercial semiconductors are extrinsic; that is, the electrical behav¬ 
ior is determined by impurities, which, when present in even minute concentrations, 
introduce excess electrons or holes. For example, an impurity concentration of one 
atom in 10 12 is sufficient to render silicon extrinsic at room temperature. 

n-Type Extrinsic Semiconduction 

To illustrate how extrinsic semiconduction is accomplished, consider again the ele¬ 
mental semiconductor silicon. An Si atom has four electrons, each of which is co¬ 
valently bonded with one of four adjacent Si atoms. Now, suppose that an impurity 
atom with a valence of 5 is added as a substitutional impurity; possibilities would 
include atoms from the Group VA column of the periodic table (e.g., P, As, and Sb). 
Only four of five valence electrons of these impurity atoms can participate in the 
bonding because there are only four possible bonds with neighboring atoms. The 
extra nonbonding electron is loosely bound to the region around the impurity atom 
by a weak electrostatic attraction, as illustrated in Figure 18.12a. The binding en¬ 
ergy of this electron is relatively small (on the order of 0.01 eV); thus, it is easily 
removed from the impurity atom, in which case it becomes a free or conducting 
electron (Figures 18.12Z? and 18.12c). 

The energy state of such an electron may be viewed from the perspective of 
the electron band model scheme. For each of the loosely bound electrons, there ex¬ 
ists a single energy level, or energy state, which is located within the forbidden band 
gap just below the bottom of the conduction band (Figure 18.13a). The electron 
binding energy corresponds to the energy required to excite the electron from one 
of these impurity states to a state within the conduction band. Each excitation event 
(Figure 18.13Z?) supplies or donates a single electron to the conduction band; an im¬ 
purity of this type is aptly termed a donor. Because each donor electron is excited 
from an impurity level, no corresponding hole is created within the valence band. 

At room temperature, the thermal energy available is sufficient to excite large 
donor state numbers of electrons from donor states; in addition, some intrinsic valence-conduction 

band transitions occur, as in Figure 18 .6b, but to a negligible degree. Thus, the number

level is shifted upward in the band gap, to within the vicinity of the donor state; its 
exact position is a function of both temperature and donor concentration. 


p -Type Extrinsic Semiconduction 

An opposite effect is produced by the addition to silicon or germanium of trivalent 
substitutional impurities such as aluminum, boron, and gallium from Group IIIA 
of the periodic table. One of the covalent bonds around each of these atoms is de¬ 
ficient in an electron; such a deficiency may be viewed as a hole that is weakly 
bound to the impurity atom. This hole may be liberated from the impurity atom by 
the transfer of an electron from an adjacent bond as illustrated in Figure 18.14. In 
essence, the electron and the hole exchange positions. A moving hole is considered 
to be in an excited state and participates in the conduction process, in a manner 
analogous to an excited donor electron, as described earlier. 

Extrinsic excitations, in which holes are generated, may also be represented us¬ 
ing the band model. Each impurity atom of this type introduces an energy level 
within the band gap, above yet very close to the top of the valence band (Figure 
18.15a). A hole is imagined to be created in the valence band by the thermal exci¬ 
tation of an electron from the valence band into this impurity electron state, as 
demonstrated in Figure 18.156. With such a transition, only one carrier is produced —

a hole in the valence band; a free electron is not created in either the impurity level 
or the conduction band. An impurity of this type is called an acceptor, because it is 
capable of accepting an electron from the valence band, leaving behind a hole. It 
follows that the energy level within the band gap introduced by this type of impu¬ 
rity is called an acceptor state. 

For this type of extrinsic conduction, holes are present in much higher con¬ 
centrations than electrons (i.e.,/? >> n ), and under these circumstances a material 
is termed p-type because positively charged particles are primarily responsible for 
electrical conduction. Of course, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons are 
present in minority concentrations. This gives rise to a predominance of the second 
term on the right-hand side of Equation 18.13, or 

<r-P\e\Ph (18.17) 

For p-type semiconductors, the Fermi level is positioned within the band gap and 
near to the acceptor level. 

Extrinsic semiconductors (both n- and p-type) are produced from materials that 
are initially of extremely high purity, commonly having total impurity contents on 
the order of 1CT 7 at%. Controlled concentrations of specific donors or acceptors 
are then intentionally added, using various techniques. Such an alloying process in 
semiconducting materials is termed doping. 

In extrinsic semiconductors, large numbers of charge carriers (either electrons 
or holes, depending on the impurity type) are created at room temperature, by the 
available thermal energy. As a consequence, relatively high room-temperature elec¬ 
trical conductivities are obtained in extrinsic semiconductors. Most of these materi¬ 
als are designed for use in electronic devices to be operated at ambient conditions.

At relatively high temperatures, both donor- and acceptor-doped semiconducting 
materials will exhibit intrinsic behavior (Section 18.12). On the basis of discussions 
of Section 18.5 and the previous section, make a schematic plot of Fermi energy 
versus temperature for an n -type semiconductor up to a temperature at which it 
becomes intrinsic. Also note on this plot energy positions corresponding to the top 
of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band.

18.12 THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF 
CARRIER CONCENTRATION 

Figure 18.16 plots the logarithm of the intrinsic carrier concentration n t versus tem¬ 
perature for both silicon and germanium. A couple of features of this plot are worth 
noting. First, the concentrations of electrons and holes increase with temperature 
because, with rising temperature, more thermal energy is available to excite elec¬ 
trons from the valence to the conduction band (per Figure 18.6Z?). In addition, at 
all temperatures, carrier concentration in Ge is greater than for Si. This effect is due 
to germanium’s smaller band gap (0.67 versus 1.11 eV, Table 18.3); thus, for Ge, at 
any given temperature more electrons will be excited across its band gap. 

On the other hand, the carrier concentration-temperature behavior for an ex¬ 
trinsic semiconductor is much different. For example, electron concentration versus 
temperature for silicon that has been doped with 10 21 m -3 phosphorus atoms is plot¬ 
ted in Figure 18.17. [For comparison, the dashed curve shown is for intrinsic Si 
(taken from Figure 18.16)]. 6 Noted on the extrinsic curve are three regions. At

6 Note that the shapes of the “Si” curve of Figure 18.16 and the “nf curve of Figure 18.17 
are not the same even though identical parameters are plotted in both cases. This disparity 
is due to the scaling of the plot axes: temperature (i.e., horizontal) axes for both plots are 
scaled linearly; however, the carrier concentration axis of Figure 18.16 is logarithmic, 
whereas this same axis of Figure 18.17 is linear.

intermediate temperatures (between approximately 150 K and 475 K) the material 
is n -type (inasmuch as P is a donor impurity), and electron concentration is constant; 
this is termed the “extrinsic-temperature region”. 7 Electrons in the conduction band 
are excited from the phosphorus donor state (per Figure 18.13Z?), and because the 
electron concentration is approximately equal to the P content (10 21 m -3 ), virtually 
all of the phosphorus atoms have been ionized (i.e., have donated electrons). Also, 
intrinsic excitations across the band gap are insignificant in relation to these ex¬ 
trinsic donor excitations. The range of temperatures over which this extrinsic region 
exists will depend on impurity concentration; furthermore, most solid-state devices 
are designed to operate within this temperature range. 

At low temperatures, below about 100 K (Figure 18.17), electron concentration 
drops dramatically with decreasing temperature and approaches zero at 0 K. Over 
these temperatures, the thermal energy is insufficient to excite electrons from the 
P donor level into the conduction band. This is termed the “freeze-out temperature 
region” inasmuch as charged carriers (i.e., electrons) are “frozen” to the dopant atoms. 

Finally, at the high end of the temperature scale of Figure 18.17, electron con¬ 
centration increases above the P content and asymptotically approaches the intrinsic 
curve as temperature increases. This is termed the intrinsic temperature region be¬ 
cause at these high temperatures the semiconductor becomes intrinsic; that is, charge 
carrier concentrations resulting from electron excitations across the band gap first 
become equal to and then completely overwhelm the donor carrier contribution 
with rising temperature. 

^ Concept Check 18.6 

On the basis of Figure 18.17, as dopant level is increased would you expect the tem¬ 
perature at which a semiconductor becomes intrinsic to increase, to remain essen¬ 
tially the same, or to decrease? Why?

7 For donor-doped semiconductors, this region is sometimes called the saturation region; 
for acceptor-doped materials, it is often termed the exhaustion region.

18.13 FACTORS THAT AFFECT CARRIER MOBILITY 

The conductivity (or resistivity) of a semiconducting material, in addition to being 
dependent on electron and/or hole concentrations, is also a function of the charge 
carriers’ mobilities (Equation 18.13)—that is, the ease with which electrons and 
holes are transported through the crystal. Furthermore, magnitudes of electron and 
hole mobilities are influenced by the presence of those same crystalline defects that 
are responsible for the scattering of electrons in metals—thermal vibrations (i.e., 
temperature) and impurity atoms. We now explore the manner in which dopant im¬ 
purity content and temperature influence the mobilities of both electrons and holes. 

Influence of Dopant Content 

Figure 18.18 represents the dependence of electron and hole mobilities in silicon as 
a function of the dopant (both acceptor and donor) content, at room temperature- 
note that both axes on this plot are scaled logarithmically. At dopant concentra¬ 
tions less than about 10 20 m -3 , both carrier mobilities are at their maximum levels 
and independent of the doping concentration. In addition, both mobilities decrease 
with increasing impurity content. Also worth noting is that the mobility of electrons 
is always larger than the mobility of holes. 

Influence of Temperature 

The temperature dependences of electron and hole mobilities for silicon are pre¬ 
sented in Figures 18.19a and 18.19Z?, respectively. Curves for several impurity dopant 
contents are shown for both carrier types; furthermore, both sets of axes are scaled 
logarithmically. From these plots, note that, for dopant concentrations of 10 24 m -3 
and below, both electron and hole mobilities decrease in magnitude with rising tem¬ 
perature; again, this effect is due to enhanced thermal scattering of the carriers. For 
both electrons and holes, and dopant levels less than 10 20 m -3 , the dependence of 
mobility on temperature is independent of acceptor/donor concentration (i.e., is rep¬ 
resented by a single curve). Also, for concentrations greater than 10 20 m -3 , curves in 
both plots are shifted to progressively lower mobility values with increasing dopant 
level. These latter two effects are consistent with the data presented in Figure 18.18. 

These previous treatments have discussed the influence of temperature and dopant 
content on both carrier concentration and carrier mobility. Once values of n , p , p e ,

Room-Temperature and Elevated-Temperature Electrical 
Conductivity Calculations for Extrinsic Silicon 

To high-purity silicon is added 10 23 m -3 arsenic atoms. 

(a) Is this material n- type or p-type? 

(b) Calculate the room-temperature electrical conductivity of this material. 

(c) Compute the conductivity at 100°C (373 K). 

Solution 

(a) Arsenic is a Group VA element (Figure 2.6) and, therefore, will act as a 
donor in silicon, which means that this material is n- type. 

(b) At room temperature (298 K) we are within the extrinsic temperature re¬ 
gion of Figure 18.17, which means that virtually all of the arsenic atoms have 
donated electrons (i.e., n = 10 23 m -3 ). Furthermore, inasmuch as this material 
is extrinsic n- type, conductivity may be computed using Equation 18.16. Con¬ 
sequently, it is necessary for us to determine the electron mobility for a donor 
concentration of 10 23 m -3 . We can do this using Figure 18.18: at 10 23 m -3 , 
im e = 0.07 m 2 /V-s (remember that both axes of Figure 18.18 are scaled 
logarithmically). Thus, the conductivity is just 

a = n\e\iL e 

= (10 23 m -3 )(1.6 X 1(T 19 C)(0.07 m 2 /V-s) 

= 1120 (ITm) -1 

(c) To solve for the conductivity of this material at 373 K, we again use Equa¬ 
tion 18.16 with the electron mobility at this temperature. From the 10 23 m -3 
curve of Figure 18.19a, at 373 K, /m e = 0.04 m 2 /V-s, which leads to

DESIGN EXAMPLE 18.1 


Acceptor Impurity Doping in Silicon 


An extrinsic p -type silicon material is desired having a room-temperature con¬ 
ductivity of 50 (ft-m) _1 . Specify an acceptor impurity type that may be used 
as well as its concentration in atom percent to yield these electrical charac¬ 
teristics. 


Solution 

First, the elements that, when added to silicon, render it p-type, lie one group to 
the left of silicon in the periodic table. These include the group IIIA elements 
(Figure 2.6): boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium. 

Because this material is extrinsic andp-type (i.e.,p >> n), the electrical con¬ 
ductivity is a function of both hole concentration and hole mobility according to 
Equation 18.17. In addition, it will be assumed that at room temperature all of 
the acceptor dopant atoms have accepted electrons to form holes (i.e., that we 
are in the “extrinsic region” of Figure 18.17), which is to say that the number of 
holes is approximately equal to the number of acceptor impurities N a . 

This problem is complicated by the fact that p h is dependent on impurity 
content per Figure 18.18. Consequently, one approach to solving this problem is 
trial and error: assume an impurity concentration, and then compute the con¬ 
ductivity using this value and the corresponding hole mobility from its curve of 
Figure 18.18. Then on the basis of this result, repeat the process assuming an¬ 
other impurity concentration. 

For example, let us select an N a value (i.e., a p value) of 10 22 m -3 . At this 
concentration the hole mobility is approximately 0.04 m 2 /V• s (Figure 18.18); these 
values yield a conductivity of 

a =p\e\p h = (10 22 m -3 )(1.6 X 10“ 19 C)(0.04 m 2 /V-s) 

= 64 (fhm ) _1 


which is a little on the high side. Decreasing the impurity content an order of 
magnitude to 10 21 m -3 results in only a slight increase of p, h to about 0.045 m 2 /V*s 
(Figure 18.18); thus, the resulting conductivity is 

cr = (10 21 m -3 )(1.6 X 10“ 19 C)(0.045 m 2 /V-s) 

= 7.2 (fl-m)" 1 


With some fine-tuning of these numbers, a conductivity of 50 (ft-m) 1 is achieved 
when N a = p = 8 X 10 21 m -3 ; at this N a value, p h remains approximately 
0.04 m 2 /V-s. 

It next becomes necessary to calculate the concentration of acceptor impu¬ 
rity in atom percent. This computation first requires the determination of the 
number of silicon atoms per cubic meter, N si , using Equation 4.2, which is as 
follows: 


N S i =

Thus, a silicon material having a room-temperature p-type electrical con¬ 
ductivity of 50 (fFm) -1 must contain 1.60 X 1CT 5 at% boron, aluminum, gallium, 
or indium. 




THE HALL EFFECT 

For some materials, it is on occasion desired to determine the material’s majority 
charge carrier type, concentration, and mobility. Such determinations are not pos¬ 
sible from a simple electrical conductivity measurement; a Hall effect experiment 
must also be conducted. This Hall effect is a result of the phenomenon whereby a 
magnetic field applied perpendicular to the direction of motion of a charged parti¬ 
cle exerts a force on the particle perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the 
particle motion directions. 

In demonstrating the Hall effect, consider the specimen geometry shown in 
Figure 18.20, a parallelepiped specimen having one corner situated at the origin of 
a Cartesian coordinate system. In response to an externally applied electric field, the 
electrons and/or holes move in the % direction and give rise to a current I x . When a 
magnetic field is imposed in the positive z direction (denoted as B z ), the resulting 
force brought to bear on the charge carriers will cause them to be deflected in the 
y direction—holes (positively charged carriers) to the right specimen face and elec¬ 
trons (negatively charged carriers) to the left face, as indicated in the figure. Thus, a 


lx

of the Hall effect. Positive and/or 
negative charge carriers that are part 
of the I x current are deflected by the 
magnetic field B z and give rise to the 
Hall voltage, V u .

voltage, termed the Hall voltage V H , will be established in the y direction. The mag¬ 
nitude of V H will depend on I x , B z , and the specimen thickness d as follows:

In this expression R H is termed the Hall coefficient , which is a constant for a 
given material. For metals, wherein conduction is by electrons, is negative and 
equal to

(18.19) 


Thus, n may be determined, inasmuch as R H may be measured using Equation 18.18 
and the magnitude of e , the charge on an electron, is known. 

Furthermore, from Equation 18.8, the electron mobility /i e is just

Thus, the magnitude of /x e may also be determined if the conductivity cr has also 
been measured. 

For semiconducting materials, the determination of majority carrier type and 
computation of carrier concentration and mobility are more complicated and will 
not be discussed here.

18.15 SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES 

The unique electrical properties of semiconductors permit their use in devices to 
perform specific electronic functions. Diodes and transistors, which have replaced 
old-fashioned vacuum tubes, are two familiar examples. Advantages of semicon¬ 
ductor devices (sometimes termed solid-state devices ) include small size, low power 
consumption, and no warmup time. Vast numbers of extremely small circuits, each 
consisting of numerous electronic devices, may be incorporated onto a small silicon 
chip. The invention of semiconductor devices, which has given rise to miniaturized 
circuitry, is responsible for the advent and extremely rapid growth of a host of new 
industries in the past few years. 

The p-n Rectifying Junction 

diode A rectifier, or diode, is an electronic device that allows the current to flow in 

one direction only; for example, a rectifier transforms an alternating current into 
direct current. Before the advent of the p-n junction semiconductor rectifier, this 
rectifying junction operation was carried out using the vacuum tube diode. The p-n rectifying 
junction is constructed from a single piece of semiconductor that is doped so as 
to be n -type on one side and p-type on the other (Figure 18.21a). If pieces of 
n- and p-type materials are joined together, a poor rectifier results, because the 
presence of a surface between the two sections renders the device very ineffi¬ 
cient. Also, single crystals of semiconducting materials must be used in all de¬ 
vices because electronic phenomena that are deleterious to operation occur at 
grain boundaries. 

Before the application of any potential across the p-n specimen, holes will be 
the dominant carriers on the p-side, and electrons will predominate in the n- region, 
as illustrated in Figure 18.21a. An external electric potential may be established 
across a p-n junction with two different polarities. When a battery is used, the posi¬ 
tive terminal may be connected to the p-side and the negative terminal to the 
forward bias a-side; this is referred to as a forward bias. The opposite polarity (minus to p and 

.. plus to n) is termed reverse bias, 

reverse bias 

The response of the charge carriers to the application of a forward-biased poten¬ 
tial is demonstrated in Figure 18.21Z>. The holes on the p-side and the electrons on the 
a-side are attracted to the junction. As electrons and holes encounter one another near 
the junction, they continuously recombine and annihilate one another, according to 

electron + hole -> energy (18.21) 

Thus for this bias, large numbers of charge carriers flow across the semiconductor 
and to the junction, as evidenced by an appreciable current and a low resistivity.

The current-voltage characteristics for forward bias are shown on the right-hand 
half of Figure 18.22. 

For reverse bias (Figure 18.21c), both holes and electrons, as majority carriers, 
are rapidly drawn away from the junction; this separation of positive and negative 
charges (or polarization) leaves the junction region relatively free of mobile charge 
carriers. Recombination will not occur to any appreciable extent, so that the junc¬ 
tion is now highly insulative. Figure 18.22 also illustrates the current-voltage be¬ 
havior for reverse bias.

characteristics of a p-n junction for

phenomenon of breakdown is also shown.

(b ) Current versus time, showing 
rectification of voltage in (a) by a p-n 
rectifying junction having the 
voltage-current characteristics shown in 
Figure 18.22. 



The rectification process in terms of input voltage and output current is 
demonstrated in Figure 18.23. Whereas voltage varies sinusoidally with time 
(Figure 18.23a), maximum current flow for reverse bias voltage I R is extremely 
small in comparison to that for forward bias I F (Figure 18.23Z?). Furthermore, 
correspondence between I F and I R and the imposed maximum voltage (± V 0 ) is 
noted in Figure 18.22. 

At high reverse bias voltages, sometimes on the order of several hundred volts, 
large numbers of charge carriers (electrons and holes) are generated. This gives rise 
to a very abrupt increase in current, a phenomenon known as breakdown, also shown 
in Figure 18.22, and discussed in more detail in Section 18.22. 

The Transistor 

Transistors, which are extremely important semiconducting devices in today’s mi¬ 
croelectronic circuitry, are capable of two primary types of function. First, they can 
perform the same operation as their vacuum tube precursor, the triode; that is, they 
can amplify an electrical signal. In addition, they serve as switching devices in com¬ 
puters for the processing and storage of information. The two major types are the 
junction (or bimodal) transistor and the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect tran¬ 
sistor (abbreviated as MOSFET). 

Junction Transistors 

The junction transistor is composed of two p-n junctions arranged back to back in 
either the n-p-n or the p-n-p configuration; the latter variety is discussed here. 
Figure 18.24 is a schematic representation of a p-n-p junction transistor along with 
its attendant circuitry. A very thin n -type base region is sandwiched in between 
p-type emitter and collector regions. The circuit that includes the emitter-base junc¬ 
tion (junction 1) is forward biased, whereas a reverse bias voltage is applied across 
the base-collector junction (junction 2).

Figure 18.25 illustrates the mechanics of operation in terms of the motion of 
charge carriers. Because the emitter is p -type and junction 1 is forward biased, 
large numbers of holes enter the base region. These injected holes are minority 
carriers in the n -type base, and some will combine with the majority electrons. 
However, if the base is extremely narrow and the semiconducting materials have 
been properly prepared, most of these holes will be swept through the base with¬ 
out recombination, then across junction 2 and into the p -type collector. The holes 
now become a part of the emitter-collector circuit. A small increase in input volt¬ 
age within the emitter-base circuit produces a large increase in current across 
junction 2. This large increase in collector current is also reflected by a large 
increase in voltage across the load resistor, which is also shown in the circuit 
(Figure 18.24). Thus, a voltage signal that passes through a junction transistor ex¬ 
periences amplification; this effect is also illustrated in Figure 18.24 by the two 
voltage-time plots. 

Similar reasoning applies to the operation of an n-p-n transistor, except that 
electrons instead of holes are injected across the base and into the collector.

The MOSFET 

One variety of MOSFET 8 consists of two small islands of p-type semiconductor 
that are created within a substrate of n -type silicon, as shown in cross section in 
Figure 18.26; the islands are joined by a narrow p-type channel. Appropriate metal 
connections (source and drain) are made to these islands; an insulating layer of 
silicon dioxide is formed by the surface oxidation of the silicon. A final connector 
(gate) is then fashioned onto the surface of this insulating layer. 

The conductivity of the channel is varied by the presence of an electric field 
imposed on the gate. For example, imposition of a positive field on the gate will 
drive charge carriers (in this case holes) out of the channel, thereby reducing the 
electrical conductivity. Thus, a small alteration in the field at the gate will produce a 
relatively large variation in current between the source and the drain. In some re¬ 
spects, then, the operation of a MOSFET is very similar to that described for the junc¬ 
tion transistor. The primary difference is that the gate current is exceedingly small in 
comparison to the base current of a junction transistor. MOSFETs are, therefore, used 
where the signal sources to be amplified cannot sustain an appreciable current. 

Another important difference between MOSFETs and junction transistors is that 
although majority carriers dominate in the functioning of MOSFETs (i.e., holes for 
the depletion-mode p-type MOSFET of Figure 18.26), minority carriers do play a role 
with junction transistors (i.e., injected holes in the n -type base region, Figure 18.25).

Would you expect increasing temperature to influence the operation of p-n junc¬ 
tion rectifiers and transistors? Explain.

Semiconductors in Computers 

In addition to their ability to amplify an imposed electrical signal, transistors and 
diodes may also act as switching devices, a feature used for arithmetic and logical 
operations, and also for information storage in computers. Computer numbers and 
functions are expressed in terms of a binary code (i.e., numbers written to the base 2). 


8 The MOSFET described here is a depletion-mode p-type. A depletion-mode n-type is also 
possible, wherein the n- and p-regions of Figure 18.26 are reversed. 


























18.15 Semiconductor Devices * 753 


integrated circuit 


Within this framework, numbers are represented by a series of two states (some¬ 
times designated 0 and 1). Now, transistors and diodes within a digital circuit operate 
as switches that also have two states—on and off, or conducting and nonconduct¬ 
ing; “off” corresponds to one binary number state, and “on” to the other. Thus, a 
single number may be represented by a collection of circuit elements containing 
transistors that are appropriately switched. 

Flash (Solid-State Drive) Memory 

A rapidly evolving information storage technology that uses semiconductor de¬ 
vices is flash memory. As with computer storage, flash memory is programmed and 
erased electronically, as described in the preceding paragraph. However, unlike 
computer storage, the flash technology is nonvolatile —that is, no electrical power 
is needed to retain the stored information. There are no moving parts (as with mag¬ 
netic hard drives and magnetic tapes, Section 20.11), which makes flash memory 
especially attractive for general storage and transfer of data between portable devices — 
such as digital cameras, laptop computers, mobile phones, PDAs, digital audio play¬ 
ers, and game consoles. Furthermore, flash technology is packaged in memory cards 
and USB flash drives. Unlike magnetic memory, flash packages are extremely 
durable and are capable of withstanding relatively wide temperature extremes as 
well as immersion in water. 

Microelectronic Circuitry 

During the past few years, the advent of microelectronic circuitry, where millions 
of electronic components and circuits are incorporated into a very small space, has 
revolutionized the field of electronics. This revolution was precipitated, in part, by 
aerospace technology, which necessitated computers and electronic devices that 
were small and had low power requirements. As a result of refinement in process¬ 
ing and fabrication techniques, there has been an astonishing depreciation in the 
cost of integrated circuitry. Consequently, at the time of this writing, personal com¬ 
puters are affordable to large segments of the population in many countries. Also, 
the use of integrated circuits has become infused into many other facets of our 
lives—calculators, communications, watches, industrial production and control, and 
all phases of the electronics industry. 

Inexpensive microelectronic circuits are mass produced by using some very in¬ 
genious fabrication techniques. The process begins with the growth of relatively large 
cylindrical single crystals of high-purity silicon from which thin circular wafers are cut. 
Many microelectronic or integrated circuits, sometimes called chips ; are prepared on 
a single wafer. A chip is rectangular, typically on the order of 6 mm (| in.) on a side, 
and contains millions of circuit elements: diodes, transistors, resistors, and capacitors. 
Enlarged photographs of and elemental maps of a microprocessor chip are presented 
in Figure 18.27; these micrographs reveal the intricacy of integrated circuits. At this 
time, microprocessor chips with densities approaching one billion transistors are be¬ 
ing produced, and this number doubles about every 18 months. 

Microelectronic circuits consist of many layers that lie within or are stacked 
on top of the silicon wafer in a precisely detailed pattern. Using photolithographic 
techniques, for each layer, very small elements are masked in accordance with a 
microscopic pattern. Circuit elements are constructed by the selective introduction 
of specific materials [by diffusion (Section 5.6) or ion implantation] into unmasked 
regions to create localized n-type,p-type, high-resistivity, or conductive areas. This 
procedure is repeated layer by layer until the total integrated circuit has been 
fabricated, as illustrated in the MOSFET schematic (Figure 18.26). Elements of

photon depends on the particular 
atom from which it radiates. It is 
possible to selectively filter out all

Electrical Conduction 

in Ionic Ceramics and in Polymers 

Most polymers and ionic ceramics are insulating materials at room temperature 
and, therefore, have electron energy band structures similar to that represented 
in Figure 18.4c; a filled valence band is separated from an empty conduction band 
by a relatively large band gap, usually greater than 2 eV. Thus, at normal tem¬ 
peratures only very few electrons may be excited across the band gap by the 
available thermal energy, which accounts for the very small values of conduc¬ 
tivity; Table 18.4 gives the room-temperature electrical conductivities of several

of these materials. (The electrical resistivities of a large number of ceramic and 
polymeric materials are provided in Table B.9, Appendix B.) Of course, many 
materials are used on the basis of their ability to insulate, and thus a high electrical 
resistivity is desirable. With rising temperature, insulating materials experience 
an increase in electrical conductivity, which may ultimately be greater than that 
for semiconductors. 


18.16 CONDUCTION IN IONIC MATERIALS 


For ionic materials, 
conductivity is equal 
to the sum of 
electronic and ionic 
contributions 


Both cations and anions in ionic materials possess an electric charge and, as a con¬ 
sequence, are capable of migration or diffusion when an electric field is present. 
Thus an electric current will result from the net movement of these charged ions, 
which will be present in addition to current due to any electron motion. Of course, 
anion and cation migrations will be in opposite directions. The total conductivity of 
an ionic material cr total is thus equal to the sum of both electronic and ionic contri¬ 
butions, as follows: 


^"total ^"electronic ^"ionic (18.22) 

Either contribution may predominate depending on the material, its purity, and, of 
course, temperature. 

A mobility jjlj may be associated with each of the ionic species as follows:

where and D : represent, respectively, the valence and diffusion coefficient of a 
particular ion; c, /c, and T denote the same parameters as explained earlier in the 
chapter. Thus, the ionic contribution to the total conductivity increases with in¬ 
creasing temperature, as does the electronic component. However, in spite of the 
two conductivity contributions, most ionic materials remain insulative, even at ele¬ 
vated temperatures. 


18.17 ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF POLYMERS 

Most polymeric materials are poor conductors of electricity (Table 18.4) because 
of the unavailability of large numbers of free electrons to participate in the con¬ 
duction process. The mechanism of electrical conduction in these materials is 
not well understood, but it is felt that conduction in polymers of high purity is 
electronic. 

Conducting Polymers 

Polymeric materials have been synthesized that have electrical conductivities on 
par with metallic conductors; they are appropriately termed conducting polymers. 
Conductivities as high as 1.5 X 10 7 (fTm) -1 have been achieved in these materi¬ 
als; on a volume basis, this value corresponds to one-fourth of the conductivity 
of copper, or twice its conductivity on the basis of weight. 

This phenomenon is observed in a dozen or so polymers, including poly¬ 
acetylene, polyparaphenylene, polypyrrole, and polyaniline. Each of these poly¬ 
mers contains a system of alternating single and double bonds and/or aromatic 
units in the polymer chain. For example, the chain structure of polyacetylene is 
as follows: 


Repeat 

unit 


H 


H 










The valence electrons associated with the alternating single and double chain- 
bonds are delocalized, which means they are shared among the backbone atoms 
in the polymer chain—similar to the way that electrons in a partially filled band 
for a metal are shared by the ion cores. In addition, the band structure of a con¬ 
ductive polymer is characteristic of that for an electrical insulator (Figure 18.4c) — 
at 0 K, a filled valence band separated from an empty conduction band by a for¬ 
bidden energy band gap. These polymers become conductive when doped with 
appropriate impurities such as AsF 5 , SbF 5 , or iodine. As with semiconductors, con¬ 
ducting polymers may be made either n -type (i.e., free-electron dominant) or p-type 
(i.e., hole dominant) depending on the dopant. However, unlike semiconductors, 
the dopant atoms or molecules do not substitute for or replace any of the poly¬ 
mer atoms. 

The mechanism by which large numbers of free electrons and holes are gener¬ 
ated in these conducting polymers is complex and not well understood. In very 
simple terms, it appears that the dopant atoms lead to the formation of new energy 




18.18 Capacitance * 757 


bands that overlap the valence and conduction bands of the intrinsic polymer, giving 
rise to a partially filled band, and the production at room temperature of a high con¬ 
centration of free electrons or holes. Orienting the polymer chains, either mechani¬ 
cally (Section 15.7) or magnetically, during synthesis results in a highly anisotropic 
material having a maximum conductivity along the direction of orientation. 

These conducting polymers have the potential to be used in a host of applica¬ 
tions inasmuch as they have low densities, are highly flexible, and are easy to pro¬ 
duce. Rechargeable batteries and fuel cells are currently being manufactured that 
employ polymer electrodes. In many respects these batteries are superior to their 
metallic counterparts. Other possible applications include wiring in aircraft and 
aerospace components, antistatic coatings for clothing, electromagnetic screening 
materials, and electronic devices (e.g., transistors and diodes). 


DieIectric Behavior 

A dielectric material is one that is electrically insulating (nonmetallic) and ex¬ 
hibits or may be made to exhibit an electric dipole structure; that is, there is a 
separation of positive and negative electrically charged entities on a molecular or 
atomic level. This concept of an electric dipole was introduced in Section 2.7. As 
a result of dipole interactions with electric fields, dielectric materials are used in 
capacitors.

18.18 CAPACITANCE 

When a voltage is applied across a capacitor, one plate becomes positively charged, 
the other negatively charged, with the corresponding electric field directed from 
capacitance the positive to the negative. The capacitance C is related to the quantity of charge 

stored on either plate Q by

where V is the voltage applied across the capacitor. The units of capacitance are 
coulombs per volt, or farads (F). 

Now, consider a parallel-plate capacitor with a vacuum in the region between 
the plates (Figure 18.28a). The capacitance may be computed from the relationship 

C = e„y (18-25) 

where A represents the area of the plates and l is the distance between them. The 
parameter e 0 , called the permittivity of a vacuum, is a universal constant having the

which is greater than unity and represents the increase in charge storing capacity 
by insertion of the dielectric medium between the plates. The dielectric constant is 
one material property that is of prime consideration for capacitor design. The e r 
values of a number of dielectric materials are contained in Table 18.5. 

VECTORS AND POLARIZATION 

Perhaps the best approach to an explanation of the phenomenon of capacitance is 
with the aid of field vectors. To begin, for every electric dipole there is a separation 
between a positive and a negative electric charge, as demonstrated in Figure 18.29. 
An electric dipole moment p is associated with each dipole as follows: 

p = qd (18.28) 

where q is the magnitude of each dipole charge and d is the distance of separation 
between them. In reality, a dipole moment is a vector that is directed from the neg¬ 
ative to the positive charge, as indicated in Figure 18.29. In the presence of an elec¬ 
tric field % which is also a vector quantity, a force (or torque) will come to bear on 
an electric dipole to orient it with the applied field; this phenomenon is illustrated 
in Figure 18.30. The process of dipole alignment is termed polarization. 

Again, returning to the capacitor, the surface charge density D, or quantity of 
charge per unit area of capacitor plate (C/m 2 ), is proportional to the electric field. 
When a vacuum is present, then 


D 0 = e 0 <g (18.29) 

the constant of proportionality being e 0 . Furthermore, an analogous expression 
exists for the dielectric case; that is, 


D = e% 


(18.30) 


Sometimes, D is also called the dielectric displacement. 

The increase in capacitance, or dielectric constant, can be explained using a 
simplified model of polarization within a dielectric material. Consider the capacitor in 
Figure 18.31a, the vacuum situation, wherein a charge of + Q 0 is stored on the top plate 
and - Q 0 on the bottom one. When a dielectric is introduced and an electric field is 
applied, the entire solid within the plates becomes polarized (Figure 18.31c). As a result

of this polarization, there is a net accumulation of negative charge of magnitude —Q' 
at the dielectric surface near the positively charged plate and, in a similar manner, a 
surplus of +Q' charge at the surface adjacent to the negative plate. For the region of 
dielectric removed from these surfaces, polarization effects are not important. Thus, if 
each plate and its adjacent dielectric surface are considered to be a single entity, the

induced charge from the dielectric (+ Q' or — Q') may be thought of as nullifying some 
of the charge that originally existed on the plate for a vacuum (— Q 0 or + Q 0 ). The volt¬ 
age imposed across the plates is maintained at the vacuum value by increasing the 
charge at the negative (or bottom) plate by an amount —Q' , and the top plate by + <2'. 
Electrons are caused to flow from the positive to the negative plate by the external 
voltage source such that the proper voltage is reestablished. And so the charge on each 
plate is now Q 0 + Q f , having been increased by an amount Q '. 

In the presence of a dielectric, the surface charge density on the plates of a ca¬ 
pacitor may also be represented by 

D = e 0 % + P (18.31) 

where P is the polarization , or the increase in charge density above that for a vac¬ 
uum because of the presence of the dielectric; or, from Figure 18.31c, P = Q’/A, 
where A is the area of each plate. The units of P are the same as for D (C/m 2 ). 

The polarization P may also be thought of as the total dipole moment per unit 
volume of the dielectric material, or as a polarization electric field within the di¬ 
electric that results from the mutual alignment of the many atomic or molecular 
dipoles with the externally applied field %. For many dielectric materials, P is pro¬ 
portional to % through the relationship 

P = e 0 (6 r - 1)% (18.32) 

in which case e r is independent of the magnitude of the electric field. 

Table 18.6 lists the several dielectric parameters along with their units. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 18.5 

Computations of Capacitor Properties 

Consider a parallel-plate capacitor having an area of 6.45 X 10 -4 m 2 (1 in. 2 ) 
and a plate separation of 2 X 1CT 3 m (0.08 in.) across which a potential of

10 V is applied. If a material having a dielectric constant of 6.0 is positioned 
within the region between the plates, compute the following: 

(a) The capacitance 

(b) The magnitude of the charge stored on each plate 

(c) The dielectric displacement D 

(d) The polarization 


Solution 

(a) Capacitance is calculated using Equation 18.26; however, the permittivity e of 
the dielectric medium must first be determined from Equation 18.27 as follows: 

e = e r e 0 = (6.0)(8.85 X 10“ 12 F/m) 

= 5.31 X KT 11 F/m 


Thus, the capacitance is

= 1.71 X 10“ n F 


/ 6.45 X 10~ 4 m~ 2 \

(b) Because the capacitance has been determined, the charge stored may be 
computed using Equation 18.24, according to 

Q = CV = (1.71 X KT n F)(10 V) = 1.71 X 1(T 10 C 


(c) The dielectric displacement is calculated from Equation 18.30, which yields

18.20 TYPES OF POLARIZATION 

Again, polarization is the alignment of permanent or induced atomic or molecular 
dipole moments with an externally applied electric field. There are three types or 
sources of polarization: electronic, ionic, and orientation. Dielectric materials ordi¬ 
narily exhibit at least one of these polarization types depending on the material and 
also the manner of the external field application. 

Electronic Polarization 

electronic Electronic polarization may be induced to one degree or another in all atoms. It 

polarization results from a displacement of the center of the negatively charged electron cloud

relative to the positive nucleus of an atom by the electric field (Figure 18.32a). This 
polarization type is found in all dielectric materials and, of course, exists only while 
an electric field is present. 

Ionic Polarization 

Ionic polarization occurs only in materials that are ionic. An applied field acts to 
displace cations in one direction and anions in the opposite direction, which gives 
rise to a net dipole moment. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 18.325. The 
magnitude of the dipole moment for each ion pair p t is equal to the product of the 
relative displacement d L and the charge on each ion, or 

Pi — qdi (18.33) 


Orientation Polarization 

The third type, orientation polarization, is found only in substances that possess 
permanent dipole moments. Polarization results from a rotation of the permanent 
moments into the direction of the applied field, as represented in Figure 18.32c. 
This alignment tendency is counteracted by the thermal vibrations of the atoms, 
such that polarization decreases with increasing temperature. 




764 * Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties 


Total polarization of 
a substance equals 
the sum of 
electronic, ionic, and 
orientation 
polarizations 


The total polarization P of a substance is equal to the sum of the electronic, 
ionic, and orientation polarizations (P e , P h and P 0 , respectively), or 

P = P e + P i + P o (18.34) 

It is possible for one or more of these contributions to the total polarization 
to be either absent or negligible in magnitude relative to the others. For exam¬ 
ple, ionic polarization will not exist in covalently bonded materials in which no 
ions are present.

18.21 FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF 
THE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT 

In many practical situations the current is alternating (ac); that is, an applied volt¬ 
age or electric field changes direction with time, as indicated in Figure 18.23a. Now 
consider a dielectric material that is subject to polarization by an ac electric field. 
With each direction reversal, the dipoles attempt to reorient with the field, as il¬ 
lustrated in Figure 18.33, in a process requiring some finite time. For each polar¬ 
ization type, some minimum reorientation time exists, which depends on the ease 
relaxation frequency with which the particular dipoles are capable of realignment. A relaxation frequency 
is taken as the reciprocal of this minimum reorientation time. 

A dipole cannot keep shifting orientation direction when the frequency of the 
applied electric field exceeds its relaxation frequency and, therefore, will not make 
a contribution to the dielectric constant. The dependence of e r on the field fre¬ 
quency is represented schematically in Figure 18.34 for a dielectric medium that 
exhibits all three types of polarization; note that the frequency axis is scaled loga¬ 
rithmically. As indicated in Figure 18.34, when a polarization mechanism ceases to 
function, there is an abrupt drop in the dielectric constant; otherwise, e r is virtually 
frequency independent. Table 18.5 gave values of the dielectric constant at 60 Hz 
and 1 MHz; these provide an indication of this frequency dependence at the low 
end of the frequency spectrum. 

The absorption of electrical energy by a dielectric material that is subjected to 
an alternating electric field is termed dielectric loss. This loss may be important at 
electric field frequencies in the vicinity of the relaxation frequency for each of the

operative dipole types for a specific material. A low dielectric loss is desired at the 
frequency of utilization. 

18.22 DIELECTRIC STRENGTH 

When very high electric fields are applied across dielectric materials, large numbers 
of electrons may suddenly be excited to energies within the conduction band. As a 
result, the current through the dielectric by the motion of these electrons increases 
dramatically; sometimes localized melting, burning, or vaporization produces irre¬ 
versible degradation and perhaps even failure of the material. This phenomenon is 
dielectric strength known as dielectric breakdown. The dielectric strength, sometimes called the break¬ 
down strength, represents the magnitude of an electric field necessary to produce 
breakdown. Table 18.5 presented dielectric strengths for several materials. 

18.23 DIELECTRIC MATERIALS 

A number of ceramics and polymers are used as insulators and/or in capacitors. 
Many of the ceramics, including glass, porcelain, steatite, and mica, have dielectric 
constants within the range of 6 to 10 (Table 18.5). These materials also exhibit a 
high degree of dimensional stability and mechanical strength. Typical applications 
include power line and electrical insulation, switch bases, and light receptacles. The 
titania (Ti0 2 ) and titanate ceramics, such as barium titan ate (BaTi0 3 ), can be made 
to have extremely high dielectric constants, which render them especially useful for 
some capacitor applications. 

The magnitude of the dielectric constant for most polymers is less than for ce¬ 
ramics, because the latter may exhibit greater dipole moments: e r values for polymers 
generally lie between 2 and 5. These materials are commonly used for insulation of 
wires, cables, motors, generators, and so on, and, in addition, for some capacitors. 

Other Electrical 
Characteristics of Materials 

Two other relatively important and novel electrical characteristics that are found in 
some materials deserve brief mention—namely, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. 














766 * Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties 

18.24 FERROELECTRICITY 

ferroelectric The group of dielectric materials called ferroelectrics exhibit spontaneous 

polarization —that is, polarization in the absence of an electric field. They are the 
dielectric analogue of ferromagnetic materials, which may display permanent 
magnetic behavior. There must exist in ferroelectric materials permanent elec¬ 
tric dipoles, the origin of which is explained for barium titanate, one of the most 
common ferroelectrics. The spontaneous polarization is a consequence of the po¬ 
sitioning of the Ba 2+ , Ti 4+ , and O 2- ions within the unit cell, as represented in 
Figure 18.35. The Ba 2+ ions are located at the corners of the unit cell, which is 
of tetragonal symmetry (a cube that has been elongated slightly in one direc¬ 
tion). The dipole moment results from the relative displacements of the O 2- and 
Ti 4+ ions from their symmetrical positions as shown in the side view of the unit 
cell. The O 2- ions are located near, but slightly below, the centers of each of the 
six faces, whereas the Ti 4+ ion is displaced upward from the unit cell center. Thus, 
a permanent ionic dipole moment is associated with each unit cell (Figure 18.35Z?). 
However, when barium titanate is heated above its ferroelectric Curie tempera¬ 
ture [120°C (250°F)], the unit cell becomes cubic, and all ions assume symmetric 
positions within the cubic unit cell; the material now has a perovskite crystal 
structure (Section 12.2), and the ferroelectric behavior ceases. 

Spontaneous polarization of this group of materials results as a consequence of 
interactions between adjacent permanent dipoles wherein they mutually align, all 
in the same direction. For example, with barium titanate, the relative displacements 
of O 2- and Ti 4+ ions are in the same direction for all the unit cells within some vol¬ 
ume region of the specimen. Other materials display ferroelectricity; these include 
Rochelle salt (NaKC 4 H 4 0 6 *4H 2 0), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH 2 P0 4 ), 
potassium niobate (KNb0 3 ), and lead zirconate-titanate (Pb[Zr0 3 , Ti0 3 ]). Ferro¬ 
electrics have extremely high dielectric constants at relatively low applied field fre¬ 
quencies; for example, at room temperature, e r for barium titanate may be as high 
as 5000. Consequently, capacitors made from these materials can be significantly 
smaller than capacitors made from other dielectric materials.

18.25 PIEZOELECTRICITY 

An unusual property exhibited by a few ceramic materials is piezoelectricity, or, lit¬ 
erally, pressure electricity: polarization is induced and an electric field is established 
across a specimen by the application of external forces. Reversing the sign of an ex¬ 
ternal force (i.e., from tension to compression) reverses the direction of the field. 
The piezoelectric effect is demonstrated in Figure 18.36. This phenomenon and ex¬ 
amples of its application were discussed in the Materials of Importance piece that 
follows Section 13.8. 

piezoelectric Piezoelectric materials are used in transducers, which are devices that convert 

electrical energy into mechanical strains, or vice versa. Some other familiar appli¬ 
cations that employ piezoelectrics include phonograph cartridges, microphones, 
speakers, audible alarms, and ultrasonic imaging. In a phonograph cartridge, as the 
stylus traverses the grooves on a record, a pressure variation is imposed on a piezo¬ 
electric material located in the cartridge, which is then transformed into an electric 
signal and is amplified before going to the speaker. 

Piezoelectric materials include titanates of barium and lead, lead zirconate 
(PbZr0 3 ), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 P0 4 ), and quartz. This prop¬ 
erty is characteristic of materials having complicated crystal structures with a low 
degree of symmetry. The piezoelectric behavior of a polycrystalline specimen may 
be improved by heating above its Curie temperature and then cooling to room tem¬ 
perature in a strong electric field.

Would you expect the physical dimensions of a piezoelectric material such as BaTi0 3 
to change when it is subjected to an electric field? Why or why not?

SUMMARY 


Ohm's Law 

Electrical Conductivity 

• The ease with which a material is capable of transmitting an electric current is 
expressed in terms of electrical conductivity or its reciprocal, electrical resistivity 
(Equations 18.2 and 18.3). 

• The relationship between applied voltage, current, and resistance is Ohm’s law 
(Equation 18.1). An equivalent expression, Equation 18.5, relates current density, 
conductivity, and electric field intensity. 





























768 * Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties 

• On the basis of its conductivity, a solid material may be classified as a metal, a 
semiconductor, or an insulator. 

Electronic and Ionic Conduction 

• For most materials, an electric current results from the motion of free electrons, 
which are accelerated in response to an applied electric field. 

• In ionic materials, there may also be a net motion of ions, which also makes a 
contribution to the conduction process. 

Energy Band Structures in Solids 

Conduction in Terms of Band and Atomic Bonding Models 

• The number of free electrons depends on the electron energy band structure of 
the material. 

• An electron band is just a series of electron states that are closely spaced with 
respect to energy, and one such band may exist for each electron subshell found 
in the isolated atom. 

• Electron energy band structure refers to the manner in which the outermost bands 
are arranged relative to one another and then filled with electrons. 

For metals, two band structure types are possible (Figures 18.4a and 18.4Z?) — 
empty electron states are adjacent to filled ones. 

Band structures for semiconductors and insulators are similar—both have a 
forbidden energy band gap that, at 0 K, lies between a filled valence band 
and an empty conduction band. The magnitude of this band gap is relatively 
wide (>2 eV) for insulators (Figure 18.4c), and relatively narrow (<2 eV) 
for semiconductors (Figure 18.4J). 

• An electron becomes free by being excited from a filled state to an available 
empty state at a higher energy. 

Relatively small energies are required for electron excitations in metals 
(Figure 18.5), giving rise to large numbers of free electrons. 

Greater energies are required for electron excitations in semiconductors and 
insulators (Figure 18.6), which accounts for their lower free electron con¬ 
centrations and smaller conductivity values. 

Electron Mobility 

• Free electrons being acted on by an electric field are scattered by imperfections 
in the crystal lattice. The magnitude of electron mobility is indicative of the fre¬ 
quency of these scattering events. 

• In many materials, the electrical conductivity is proportional to the product of 
the electron concentration and the mobility (per Equation 18.8). 

Electrical Resistivity of Metals 

• For metallic materials, electrical resistivity increases with temperature, impurity 
content, and plastic deformation. The contribution of each to the total resistivity 
is additive—per Matthiessen’s rule, Equation 18.9. 

• Thermal and impurity contributions (for both solid solutions and two-phase 
alloys) are described by Equations 18.10,18.11, and 18.12. 

Intrinsic Semiconduction 

Extrinsic Semiconduction 

• Semiconductors may be either elements (Si and Ge) or covalently bonded 
compounds. 


Summary • 769 


• With these materials, in addition to free electrons, holes (missing electrons in the 
valence band) may also participate in the conduction process (Figure 18.11). 

• Semiconductors are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic. 

For intrinsic behavior, the electrical properties are inherent in the pure ma¬ 
terial, and electron and hole concentrations are equal. The electrical con¬ 
ductivity may be computed using Equation 18.13 (or Equation 18.15). 

Electrical behavior is dictated by impurities for extrinsic semiconductors. 
Extrinsic semiconductors may be either n- or p-type depending on whether 
electrons or holes, respectively, are the predominant charge carriers. 

• Donor impurities introduce excess electrons (Figures 18.12 and 18.13); acceptor 
impurities introduce excess holes (Figures 18.14 and 18.15). 

• The electrical conductivity on an n- type semiconductor may be calculated using 
Equation 18.16; for p-type, Equation 18.17 is employed. 

The Temperature Dependence of Carrier Concentration 

Factors That Affect Carrier Mobility 

• With rising temperature, intrinsic carrier concentration increases dramatically 
(Figure 18.16). 

• For extrinsic semiconductors, on a plot of majority carrier concentration versus 
temperature, carrier concentration is independent of temperature in the “extrin¬ 
sic region” (Figure 18.17). The magnitude of carrier concentration in this region 
is approximately equal to the impurity level. 

• For extrinsic semiconductors, electron and hole mobilities (1) decrease as impu¬ 
rity content increases (Figure 18.18), and (2) in general, decrease with rising tem¬ 
perature (Figures 18.19a and 18.19b). 

The Hall Effect 

• Using a Hall effect experiment, it is possible to determine the charge carrier type 
(i.e., electron or hole), as well as carrier concentration and mobility. 

Semiconductor Devices 

• A number of semiconducting devices employ the unique electrical characteris¬ 
tics of these materials to perform specific electronic functions. 

• The p-n rectifying junction (Figure 18.21) is used to transform alternating cur¬ 
rent to direct current. 

• Another type of semiconductor device is the transistor, which may be used for am¬ 
plification of electrical signals, as well as for switching devices in computer circuitries. 
Junction and MOSFET transistors (Figures 18.24,18.25, and 18.26) are possible. 

Electrical Conduction in Ionic Ceramics and Polymers 

• Most ionic ceramics and polymers are insulators at room temperature. Electrical 
conductivities range between about 10 -9 and 1CT 18 (fl-m) _1 ; by way of compar¬ 
ison, for most metals a is on the order of 10 7 (fl*m) _1 . 

Dielectric Behavior 

Capacitance 

Field Vectors and Polarization 

• A dipole is said to exist when there is a net spatial separation of positively and 
negatively charged entities on an atomic or molecular level. 

• Polarization is the alignment of electric dipoles with an electric field. 

• Dielectric materials are electrical insulators that may be polarized when an elec¬ 
tric field is present. 


770 * Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties 


• This polarization phenomenon accounts for the ability of the dielectrics to 
increase the charge-storing capability of capacitors. 

• Capacitance is dependent on applied voltage and quantity of charge stored 
according to Equation 18.24. 

• The charge-storing efficiency of a capacitor is expressed in terms of a dielectric 
constant or relative permittivity (Equation 18.27). 

• For a parallel-plate capacitor, capacitance is a function of the permittivity of the 
material between the plates, as well as plate area and plate separation distance 
per Equation 18.26. 

• The dielectric displacement within a dielectric medium depends on the applied 
electric field and the induced polarization according to Equation 18.31. 

• For some dielectric materials, the polarization induced by an applied electric field 
is described by Equation 18.32. 


Types of Polarization 

Frequency Dependence of the Dielectric Constant 

• Possible polarization types include electronic (Figure 18.32a), ionic (Figure 
18.326), and orientation (Figure 18.32c); not all types need be present in a par¬ 
ticular dielectric. 

• For alternating electric fields, whether a specific polarization type contributes to 
the total polarization and dielectric constant depends on frequency; each polar¬ 
ization mechanism ceases to function when the applied field frequency exceeds 
its relaxation frequency (Figure 18.34). 


Other Electrical Characteristics of Materials 

• Ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous polarization—that is, they polarize in 
the absence of an electric field. 

• An electric field is generated when mechanical stresses are applied to a piezo¬ 
electric material.

Processing/Structure/Properties/Performance Summary 

Relative to the processing, in Chapter 5 we discussed principles of diffusion as they 
apply to semiconductors (specifically silicon). In some instances, doping of impu¬ 
rity atoms (which makes the semiconductor extrinsic) is accomplished by diffusion. 
The following diagram illustrates these relationships.

One of the important structural elements of semiconductors is electron band 
structure. We discussed this concept as well as band structures for both intrinsic and 
extrinsic materials. Band structure, to some degree, is due to the covalent (or pre¬ 
dominantly covalent) interatomic bonding, which, in turn, is a consequence of the 
electron configuration of the semiconductor (Chapter 2). These relationships are 
noted in the following diagram.

For both intrinsic and extrinsic semiconduction, electrical conductivity is a func¬ 
tion of both carrier concentration and mobility of the carriers (electrons and/or 
holes). Both carrier concentration and mobility depend on temperature and impu¬ 
rity content. We note these relationships in the following diagram.

This concludes our processing/structure/properties/performance commentary for 
silicon semiconductors. For the most part, the individual components found in the pre¬ 
ceding interrelationships are conceptual in nature—that is, they represent the scientific 
(as opposed to engineering) aspects of materials. We have also generated a process¬ 
ing/structure/properties/performance relational diagram (for these materials) taken 
from the materials engineering perspective, which is presented in Figure 18.37.

Conduction in Ionic Materials 

18.47 We noted in Section 12.5 (Figure 12.22) that 
in FeO (wiistite), the iron ions can exist in 
both Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ states. The number of each 
of these ion types depends on temperature 
and the ambient oxygen pressure. Further¬ 
more, we also noted that in order to retain 
electroneutrality, one Fe 2+ vacancy will be 
created for every two Fe 3+ ions that are 
formed; consequently, in order to reflect the 
existence of these vacancies the formula for 
wiistite is often represented as Fe^^O, 
where % is some small fraction less than unity. 

In this nonstoichiometric Fe (1 _ x )0 mate¬ 
rial, conduction is electronic, and, in fact, it be¬ 
haves as a p-type semiconductor. That is, the 
Fe 3+ ions act as electron acceptors, and it is 
relatively easy to excite an electron from the 
valence band into an Fe 3+ acceptor state, with 
the formation of a hole. Determine the elec¬ 
trical conductivity of a specimen of wiistite 
that has a hole mobility of 1.0 X 10 -5 m 2 /V*s 
and for which the value of x is 0.060. Assume 



778 * Chapter 18 / Electrical Properties 


that the acceptor states are saturated (i.e., one 
hole exists for every Fe 3+ ion). Wiistite has 
the sodium chloride crystal structure with a 
unit cell edge length of 0.437 nm. 

18.48 At temperatures between 775°C (1048 K) 
and 1100°C (1373 K), the activation energy 
and preexponential for the diffusion coeffi¬ 
cient of Fe 2+ in FeO are 102,000 J/mol and 
7.3 X 10 -8 m 2 /s, respectively. Compute the 
mobility for an Fe 2+ ion at 1000°C (1273 K). 

Capacitance 

18.49 A parallel-plate capacitor using a dielectric 
material having an e r of 2.5 has a plate 
spacing of 1 mm (0.04 in.). If another mate¬ 
rial having a dielectric constant of 4.0 is used 
and the capacitance is to be unchanged, what 
must be the new spacing between the plates? 

18.50 A parallel-plate capacitor with dimensions 
of 100 mm by 25 mm and a plate separation 
of 3 mm must have a minimum capacitance of

Electrical Resistivity of Metals 

18.D1 A 95 wt% Pt-5 wt% Ni alloy is known to 
have an electrical resistivity of 2.35 X 10 -7 
at room temperature (25°C). Calculate 
the composition of a platinum-nickel alloy 
that gives a room-temperature resistivity of 
1.75 X 10 7 Il*m. The room-temperature 
resistivity of pure platinum may be deter¬ 
mined from the data in Table 18.1; assume 
that platinum and nickel form a solid

18.D2 Using information contained in Figures 18.8 
and 18.38, determine the electrical conduc¬ 
tivity of an 80 wt% Cu-20 wt% Zn alloy at

18.D3 Is it possible to alloy copper with nickel

electrical conductivity of 2.5 X 10 6 (fTrn) -1 ? 
If not, why? If so, what concentration of nickel 
is required? You may want to consult 
Figure 7.16a.

18.D4 Specify an acceptor impurity type and con¬ 
centration (in weight percent) that will pro¬ 
duce a p-type silicon material having a room

18.D5 One integrated circuit design calls for dif¬ 
fusing boron into very high-purity silicon at 
an elevated temperature. It is necessary that 
at a distance 0.2 gm from the surface of the 
silicon wafer, the room-temperature electri¬ 
cal conductivity be 1.2 X 10 3 (ft-m) _1 . The 
concentration of B at the surface of the Si 
is maintained at a constant level of 1.0 X 
10 25 m -3 ; furthermore, it is assumed that the 
concentration of B in the original Si mate¬ 
rial is negligible, and that at room temper¬ 
ature the boron atoms are saturated. Specify 
the temperature at which this diffusion heat 
treatment is to take place if the treatment 
time is to be one hour. The diffusion 
coefficient for the diffusion of B in Si is a 
function of temperature as

Semiconductor Devices 


18.D6 One of the procedures in the production of 
integrated circuits is the formation of a thin 
insulating layer of Si0 2 on the surface of 
chips (see Figure 18.26). This is accom¬ 
plished by oxidizing the surface of the 
silicon by subjecting it to an oxidizing 
atmosphere (i.e., gaseous oxygen or water 
vapor) at an elevated temperature. The rate 
of growth of the oxide film is parabolic— 
that is, the thickness of the oxide layer (x) 
is a function of time ( t ) according to the 
following equation: 

x 2 - Bt (18.37) 


Here the parameter B is dependent on both 
temperature and the oxidizing atmosphere. 

(a) For an atmosphere of 0 2 at a pressure 
of 1 atm, the temperature dependence of B 
(in units of ^tm 2 /h) is as follows: 


B = 800 exp 


1.24 eV\

(18.38a) 


where k is Boltzmann’s constant (8.62 X 
1CT 5 eV/atom) and T is in K. Calculate the 
time required to grow an oxide layer (in an 
atmosphere of 0 2 ) that is 75 nm thick at 
both 750°C and 900°C. 

(b) In an atmosphere of H 2 0 (1 atm pres¬ 
sure), the expression for B (again in units of 
/i m 2 /h) is 

B = 215 exp ^ - °' 7 ^ V ) (18.38b) 


Now calculate the time required to grow an 
oxide layer that is 75 nm thick (in an at¬ 
mosphere of H 2 0) at both 750°C and 900°C, 
and compare these times with those com¬ 
puted in part (a).

18.D8 Problem 18.47 noted that FeO (wiistite) 
may behave as a semiconductor by virtue of 
the transformation of Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ and the 
creation of Fe 2+ vacancies; the maintenance 
of electroneutrality requires that for every 
two Fe 3+ ions, one vacancy is formed. The 
existence of these vacancies is reflected in 
the chemical formula of this nonstoichio- 


metric wiistite as Fe^-^O, where x is a small 
number having a value less than unity. The 
degree of nonstoichiometry (i.e., the value 
of x) may be varied by changing tempera¬ 
ture and oxygen partial pressure. Compute 
the value of x that is required to produce an 
Fe(!_ x )0 material having a p-type electrical 
conductivity of 2000 (H‘m) _1 ; assume that 
the hole mobility is 1.0 X 10 -5 m 2 /V*s, the 
crystal structure for FeO is sodium chloride

and the acceptor states are saturated.

ne type of thermostat—a device that is used to regulate temperature— 
utilizes the phenomenon of thermal expansion (the elongation of a material as it is 
heated). The heart of this type of thermostat is a bimetallic strip—strips of two 
metals, having different coefficients of thermal expansion, that have been bonded 
along their lengths. A change in temperature will cause this strip to bend; upon 
heating, the metal having the greater expansion coefficient will elongate more pro¬ 
ducing the direction of bending shown in Figure (a). In these thermostats, the 
bimetallic strip is as a coil or spiral [Figure (b)]; this configuration provides for a 
relatively long bimetallic strip, more deflection for a given temperature change, 
and greater accuracy. The metal having the higher expansion coefficient is located on the underside of the strip such that, 
upon heating, the coil tends to unwind. Attached to the end of the coil is a mercury switch—a small glass bulb that contains 
several drops of mercury [Figure (b)]. This switch is mounted such that deflections of the coil end (when temperature is 
changed) tips the bulb one way or the other; accordingly the blob of mercury will roll from one end of the bulb to the other. 
When temperature reaches the set point of the thermostat, electrical contact is made as the mercury rolls to one end; this 

switches on the heating or cooling unit (e.g., furnace or air condi¬ 
tioner). The unit shuts off when a limit temperature is achieved and 
as the bulb tilts in the other direction, the blob of mercury rolls to 
the other end, and electrical contact is broken. 

The photograph of Figure ( d ) shows the consequences of a 
scorching heatwave that occurred in Melbourne, Australia: rail lines 
buckled as a result of stresses from unanticipated thermal expansion.

WHY STUDY the Thermal Properties of Materials? 


Of the three primary material types, ceramics are the 
most susceptible to thermal shock—brittle fracture 
resulting from internal stresses that are established 
within a ceramic piece as a result of rapid changes in 
temperature (normally upon cooling). Thermal shock is 
normally an undesirable event, and the susceptibility of 
a ceramic material to this phenomenon is a function of 
its thermal and mechanical properties (coefficient of 
thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, modulus of 


elasticity, and fracture strength). From a knowledge of 
the relationships between thermal shock parameters 
and these properties, it is possible (l) in some cases, to 
make appropriate alterations of the thermal and/or 
mechanical characteristics in order to render a ceramic 
more thermally shock resistant; and (2) for a specific 
ceramic material, to estimate the maximum allowable 
temperature change without causing fracture. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. Define heat capacity and specific heat. 

2. Note the primary mechanism by which thermal 
energy is assimilated in solid materials. 

3. Determine the linear coefficient of thermal 
expansion given the length alteration that 
accompanies a specified temperature change. 

4. Briefly explain the phenomenon of thermal 
expansion from an atomic perspective 


using a potential-energy-versus-interatomic- 
separation plot. 

5. Define thermal conductivity. 

6. Note the two principal mechanisms of heat 
conduction in solids, and compare the relative 
magnitudes of these contributions for each of 
metals, ceramics, and polymeric materials. 


19.1 INTRODUCTION 

Thermal property refers to the response of a material to the application of heat. As 
a solid absorbs energy in the form of heat, its temperature rises and its dimensions 
increase. The energy may be transported to cooler regions of the specimen if tem¬ 
perature gradients exist, and ultimately, the specimen may melt. Heat capacity, ther¬ 
mal expansion, and thermal conductivity are properties that are often critical in the 
practical utilization of solids. 


19.2 HEAT CAPACITY 


heat capacity 

Definition of heat 
capacity—ratio of 
energy change 
(energy gained or 
lost) and the 
resulting 

temperature change 

specific heat 


A solid material, when heated, experiences an increase in temperature signifying 
that some energy has been absorbed. Heat capacity is a property that is indicative 
of a material’s ability to absorb heat from the external surroundings; it represents 
the amount of energy required to produce a unit temperature rise. In mathemati¬ 
cal terms, the heat capacity C is expressed as follows: 

dQ 

c = ^ (19.1) 

where dQ is the energy required to produce a dT temperature change. Ordinarily, heat 
capacity is specified per mole of material (e.g., J/mohK, or cal/mohK). Specific heat 
(often denoted by a lowercase c ) is sometimes used; this represents the heat capacity 
per unit mass and has various units (J/kg-K, cal/g*K, Btu/lb m *°F).

Positions displaced because of vibrations 


There are really two ways in which this property may be measured, according 
to the environmental conditions accompanying the transfer of heat. One is the heat 
capacity while maintaining the specimen volume constant, C v \ the other is for con¬ 
stant external pressure, which is denoted C p . The magnitude of C p is almost always 
greater than C v \ however, this difference is very slight for most solid materials at 
room temperature and below. 

Vibrational Heat Capacity 

In most solids the principal mode of thermal energy assimilation is by the increase 
in vibrational energy of the atoms. Again, atoms in solid materials are constantly 
vibrating at very high frequencies and with relatively small amplitudes. Rather than 
being independent of one another, the vibrations of adjacent atoms are coupled by 
virtue of the atomic bonding. These vibrations are coordinated in such a way that 
traveling lattice waves are produced, a phenomenon represented in Figure 19.1. 
These may be thought of as elastic waves or simply sound waves, having short wave¬ 
lengths and very high frequencies, which propagate through the crystal at the ve¬ 
locity of sound. The vibrational thermal energy for a material consists of a series of 
these elastic waves, which have a range of distributions and frequencies. Only cer¬ 
tain energy values are allowed (the energy is said to be quantized ), and a single 
phonon quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon. (A phonon is analogous to the 

quantum of electromagnetic radiation, the photon.) On occasion, the vibrational 
waves themselves are termed phonons. 

The thermal scattering of free electrons during electronic conduction (Section 
18.7) is by these vibrational waves, and these elastic waves also participate in the 
transport of energy during thermal conduction (see Section 19.4).

volume) on

(near 0 K) 


Temperature Dependence of the Heat Capacity 

The variation with temperature of the vibrational contribution to the heat capacity 
at constant volume for many relatively simple crystalline solids is shown in 
Figure 19.2. The C v is zero at 0 K, but it rises rapidly with temperature; this cor¬ 
responds to an increased ability of the lattice waves to enhance their average en¬ 
ergy with ascending temperature. At low temperatures the relationship between 
C v and the absolute temperature T is 


C V = AT 3 (19.2) 

where A is a temperature-independent constant. Above what is called the Debye tem¬ 
perature 0 D , C v levels off and becomes essentially independent of temperature at a value 
of approximately 3 R, R being the gas constant. Thus, even though the total energy of 
the material is increasing with temperature, the quantity of energy required to produce 
a one-degree temperature change is constant. The value of 0 D is below room temper¬ 
ature for many solid materials, and 25 J/moTK is a reasonable room-temperature 
approximation for C v . Table 19.1 presents experimental specific heats for a number of 
materials; c p values for still more materials are tabulated in Table B.8 of Appendix B. 


Other Heat Capacity Contributions 

Other energy-absorptive mechanisms also exist that can add to the total heat 
capacity of a solid. In most instances, however, these are minor relative to the 
magnitude of the vibrational contribution. There is an electronic contribution in 
that electrons absorb energy by increasing their kinetic energy. However, this is 
possible only for free electrons—those that have been excited from filled states 
to empty states above the Fermi energy (Section 18.6). In metals, only electrons 
at states near the Fermi energy are capable of such transitions, and these repre¬ 
sent only a very small fraction of the total number. An even smaller proportion 
of electrons experiences excitations in insulating and semiconducting materials. 
Hence, this electronic contribution is ordinarily insignificant, except at temper¬ 
atures near 0 K. 

Furthermore, in some materials other energy-absorptive processes occur at spe¬ 
cific temperatures—for example, the randomization of electron spins in a ferro¬ 
magnetic material as it is heated through its Curie temperature. A large spike is 
produced on the heat-capacity-versus-temperature curve at the temperature of this 
transformation.

versus-interatomic-distance curve, there is no increase in interatomic separation with rising 
temperature (i.e., r x = r 2 = r 3 ). (Adapted from R. M. Rose, L. A. Shepard, and J. Wulff,

where / 0 and If represent, respectively, initial and final lengths with the temperature 
change from T 0 to T f . The parameter a t is called the linear coefficient of thermal 
expansion; it is a material property that is indicative of the extent to which a mate¬ 
rial expands upon heating and has units of reciprocal temperature [(°C) _1 or (°F) -1 ]. 
Of course, heating or cooling affects all the dimensions of a body, with a resultant 
change in volume. Volume changes with temperature may be computed from 

AV 

— = (19.4) 

where AV and V 0 are the volume change and the original volume, respectively, and 
a v symbolizes the volume coefficient of thermal expansion. In many materials, the 
value of a v is anisotropic; that is, it depends on the crystallographic direction along 
which it is measured. For materials in which the thermal expansion is isotropic, a v 
is approximately 3a z . 

From an atomic perspective, thermal expansion is reflected by an increase in the 
average distance between the atoms. This phenomenon can best be understood by 
consultation of the potential-energy-versus-interatomic-spacing curve for a solid 
material introduced previously (Figure 23b), and reproduced in Figure 193a. The 
curve is in the form of a potential energy trough, and the equilibrium interatomic 
spacing at 0 K, r 0 , corresponds to the trough minimum. Heating to successively higher 
temperatures (7,, T 2 , T 3 , etc.) raises the vibrational energy from E, to E 2 to E 3 , and 
so on. The average vibrational amplitude of an atom corresponds to the trough width 
at each temperature, and the average interatomic distance is represented by the mean 
position, which increases with temperature from r 0 to r x to r 2 , and so on. 

Thermal expansion is really due to the asymmetric curvature of this potential 
energy trough, rather than the increased atomic vibrational amplitudes with rising 
temperature. If the potential energy curve were symmetric (Figure 193b), there 
would be no net change in interatomic separation and, consequently, no thermal 
expansion. 



















19.3 Thermal Expansion * 787 


thermal shock 


For each class of materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers), the greater the 
atomic bonding energy, the deeper and more narrow this potential energy trough. 
As a result, the increase in interatomic separation with a given rise in temperature 
will be lower, yielding a smaller value of oq. Table 19.1 lists the linear coefficients 
of thermal expansion for several materials. With regard to temperature dependence, 
the magnitude of the coefficient of expansion increases with rising temperature. The 
values in Table 19.1 are taken at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. A 
more comprehensive list of coefficients of thermal expansion is provided in Table 
B.6 of Appendix B. 

Metals 

As noted in Table 19.1, linear coefficients of thermal expansion for some of the 
common metals range between about 5 X 1CT 6 and 25 X 1CT 6 (°C) _1 ; these values 
are intermediate in magnitude between those for ceramic and polymeric materials. 
As the following Materials of Importance box explains, several low-expansion and 
controlled-expansion metal alloys have been developed, which are used in applica¬ 
tions requiring dimensional stability with temperature variations. 

Ceramics 

Relatively strong interatomic bonding forces are found in many ceramic materials as 
reflected in comparatively low coefficients of thermal expansion; values typically range 
between about 0.5 X 1CT 6 and 15 X 1CT 6 (°C) _1 . For noncrystalline ceramics and also 
those having cubic crystal structures, a t is isotropic. Otherwise, it is anisotropic; some 
ceramic materials, upon heating, contract in some crystallographic directions while 
expanding in others. For inorganic glasses, the coefficient of expansion is dependent 
on composition. Fused silica (high-purity Si0 2 glass) has a small expansion coefficient, 
0.4 X 10 -6 (°C) _1 . This is explained by a low atomic packing density such that inter¬ 
atomic expansion produces relatively small macroscopic dimensional changes. 

Ceramic materials that are to be subjected to temperature changes must have co¬ 
efficients of thermal expansion that are relatively low and isotropic. Otherwise, these 
brittle materials may experience fracture as a consequence of nonuniform dimen¬ 
sional changes in what is termed thermal shock, as discussed later in the chapter. 

Polymers 

Some polymeric materials experience very large thermal expansions upon heating, 
as indicated by coefficients that range from approximately 50 X 1CT 6 to 400 X 1CT 6 
(°C) _1 . The highest a z values are found in linear and branched polymers because 
the secondary intermolecular bonds are weak, and there is a minimum of crosslink¬ 
ing. With increased crosslinking, the magnitude of the expansion coefficient dimin¬ 
ishes; the lowest coefficients are found in the thermosetting network polymers such 
as phenol-formaldehyde, in which the bonding is almost entirely covalent.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Invar and Other Low-Expansion Alloys 


I n 1896, Charles-Edouard Guillaume of France 
made an interesting and important discovery 
that earned him the 1920 Nobel Prize in physics: 
an iron-nickel alloy that has a very low (near-zero) 
coefficient of thermal expansion between room 
temperature and approximately 230°C.This material 
became the forerunner of a family of “low- 
expansion” (also sometimes called “controlled- 
expansion”) metal alloys. Its composition is 64 wt% 
Fe-36 wt% Ni, and it has been given the trade 
name of Invar because the length of a specimen 
of this material is virtually invariable with changes 
in temperature. Its coefficient of thermal expan¬ 
sion near room temperature is 1.6 X 1CT 6 (°C) _1 . 

One might surmise that this near-zero expan¬ 
sion is explained by a symmetrical potential-energy- 
versus-interatomic-distance curve (Figure 193b). 
Such is not so; rather, this behavior relates to the 
magnetic characteristics of Invar. Both iron and 
nickel are ferromagnetic materials (Section 20.4). A 
ferromagnetic material may be made to form a per¬ 
manent and strong magnet; upon heating, this prop¬ 
erty disappears at a specific temperature, called the 
Curie temperature , which varies from one ferro¬ 
magnetic material to another (Section 20.6). As a 
specimen of Invar is heated, its tendency to expand 
is counteracted by a contraction phenomenon that 
is associated with its ferromagnetic properties 
(which is termed magnetostriction). Above its Curie 
temperature (approximately 230°C), Invar expands 
in a normal manner, and its coefficient of thermal 
expansion assumes a much greater value. 

Heat-treating and processing of Invar will also 
affect its thermal expansion characteristics. The low¬ 
est a t values result for specimens quenched from el¬ 
evated temperatures (near 800°C) that are then cold 
worked. Annealing leads to an increase in a t . 

Other low-expansion alloys have been devel¬ 
oped. One of these is called Super Invar because 
its thermal expansion coefficient [0.72 X 1CT 6 
(°C) -1 ] is lower than the value for Invar. However, 
the temperature range over which its low expan¬ 
sion characteristics persist is relatively narrow. 
Compositionally, for Super Invar some of the 
nickel in Invar is replaced by another ferromag¬ 
netic metal, cobalt; Super Invar contains 63 wt% 
Fe, 32 wt% Ni, and 5 wt% Co. 


Another such alloy, with the trade name of 
Kovar, has been designed to have expansion char¬ 
acteristics close to those of borosilicate (or Pyrex) 
glass; when joined to Pyrex and subjected to tem¬ 
perature variations, thermal stresses and possible 
fracture at the junction are avoided. The composition 
of Kovar is 54 wt% Fe, 29 wt% Ni, and 17 wt% Co. 

These low-expansion alloys are employed in 
applications that require dimensional stability with 
temperature fluctuations, including the following: 

• Compensating pendulums and balance wheels 
for mechanical clocks and watches 

• Structural components in optical and laser 
measuring systems that require dimensional sta¬ 
bilities on the order of a wavelength of light 

• Bimetallic strips that are used to actuate mi¬ 
croswitches in water heating systems 

• Shadow masks on cathode-ray tubes that are used 
for television and display screens; higher contrast, 
improved brightness, and sharper definition are 
possible using low-expansion materials 

• Vessels and piping for the storage and piping of 
liquefied natural gas 



Photograph showing tubular products that have glass- 
to-metal junctions. The thermal expansion coefficient 
of the metal alloy (Kovar) is approximately the same 
as that of the Pyrex glass. Thus, with changes in 
temperature, the likelihood of the establishment of 
thermal stresses and fracture at the junction are 
minimized. [Photograph courtesy of Moores (EVIC)

19.4 THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY 


thermal conductivity 

For steady-state heat 
flow, dependence of 
heat flux on the 
thermal conductivity 
and the temperature 
gradient 


Thermal conduction is the phenomenon by which heat is transported from high- to 
low-temperature regions of a substance. The property that characterizes the ability 
of a material to transfer heat is the thermal conductivity. It is best defined in terms 
of the expression 


q = 


, dT 

k n 


(19 5) 


where q denotes the heat flux, or heat flow, per unit time per unit area (area being 
taken as that perpendicular to the flow direction), k is the thermal conductivity, and 
dT/dx is the temperature gradient through the conducting medium. 

The units of q and k are W/m 2 (Btu/ft 2 -h) and W/m-K (Btu/ft-h-°F), respec¬ 
tively. Equation 19.5 is valid only for steady-state heat flow—that is, for situations 
in which the heat flux does not change with time. Also, the minus sign in the ex¬ 
pression indicates that the direction of heat flow is from hot to cold, or down the 
temperature gradient. 

Equation 19.5 is similar in form to Fick’s first law (Equation 5.3) for steady- 
state diffusion. For these expressions, k is analogous to the diffusion coefficient D , 
and the temperature gradient parallels the concentration gradient, dC/dx. 


Mechanisms of Heat Conduction 

Heat is transported in solid materials by both lattice vibration waves (phonons) and 
free electrons. A thermal conductivity is associated with each of these mechanisms, 
and the total conductivity is the sum of the two contributions, or 

k = k t + k e (19.6) 

where k t and k e represent the lattice vibration and electron thermal conductivities, 
respectively; usually one or the other predominates. The thermal energy associated 
with phonons or lattice waves is transported in the direction of their motion. The 
k t contribution results from a net movement of phonons from high- to low- 
temperature regions of a body across which a temperature gradient exists. 

Free or conducting electrons participate in electronic thermal conduction. A 
gain in kinetic energy is imparted to the free electrons in a hot region of the 
specimen. They then migrate to colder areas, where some of this kinetic energy 
is transferred to the atoms themselves (as vibrational energy) as a consequence 
of collisions with phonons or other imperfections in the crystal. The relative con¬ 
tribution of k e to the total thermal conductivity increases with increasing free 
electron concentrations, because more electrons are available to participate in 
this heat transference process. 

Metals 

In high-purity metals, the electron mechanism of heat transport is much more ef¬ 
ficient than the phonon contribution because electrons are not as easily scattered 
as phonons and have higher velocities. Furthermore, metals are extremely good 
conductors of heat because relatively large numbers of free electrons exist that 
participate in thermal conduction. The thermal conductivities of several of the com¬ 
mon metals are given in Table 19.1; values generally range between about 20 and 
400 W/m-K.

ratio of thermal 
conductivity and the 
product of the 
electrical 
conductivity and 
temperature should 
be a constant 


Because free electrons are responsible for both electrical and thermal conduc¬ 
tion in pure metals, theoretical treatments suggest that the two conductivities should 
be related according to the Wiedemann-Franz law : 


L 


k 


(19.7) 


where a is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and L is a con¬ 
stant. The theoretical value of L, 2.44 X 1CT 8 11*W/(K) 2 , should be independent of 
temperature and the same for all metals if the heat energy is transported entirely 
by free electrons. Included in Table 19.1 are the experimental L values for these 
several metals; note that the agreement between these and the theoretical value is 
quite reasonable (well within a factor of 2). 

Alloying metals with impurities results in a reduction in the thermal conduc¬ 
tivity, for the same reason that the electrical conductivity is diminished (Section 
18.8); namely, the impurity atoms, especially if in solid solution, act as scattering 
centers, lowering the efficiency of electron motion. A plot of thermal conductivity 
versus composition for copper-zinc alloys (Figure 19.4) displays this effect.

Why is this so? Hint: you may want to consult Section 11.2. 


[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


Ceramics 

Nonmetallic materials are thermal insulators inasmuch as they lack large numbers 
of free electrons. Thus the phonons are primarily responsible for thermal conduc¬ 
tion: k e is much smaller than k t . Again, the phonons are not as effective as free 
electrons in the transport of heat energy as a result of the very efficient phonon 
scattering by lattice imperfections.

Thermal conductivity values for a number of ceramic materials are contained 
in Table 19.1; room-temperature thermal conductivities range between approxi¬ 
mately 2 and 50 W/m -K. Glass and other amorphous ceramics have lower conduc¬ 
tivities than crystalline ceramics, because the phonon scattering is much more 
effective when the atomic structure is highly disordered and irregular. 

The scattering of lattice vibrations becomes more pronounced with rising 
temperature; hence, the thermal conductivity of most ceramic materials normally 
diminishes with increasing temperature, at least at relatively low temperatures 
(Figure 19.5). As Figure 19.5 indicates, the conductivity begins to increase at higher 
temperatures, which is due to radiant heat transfer: significant quantities of infrared 
radiant heat may be transported through a transparent ceramic material. The 
efficiency of this process increases with temperature. 

Porosity in ceramic materials may have a dramatic influence on thermal con¬ 
ductivity; increasing the pore volume will, under most circumstances, result in a re¬ 
duction of the thermal conductivity. In fact, many ceramics that are used for ther¬ 
mal insulation are porous. Heat transfer across pores is ordinarily slow and 
inefficient. Internal pores normally contain still air, which has an extremely low 
thermal conductivity—approximately 0.02 W/m-K. Furthermore, gaseous convection 
within the pores is also comparatively ineffective. 



Check 19.3 


The thermal conductivity of a single-crystal ceramic specimen is slightly greater than 
a polycrystalline one of the same material. Why is this so?

792 • Chapter 19 / Thermal Properties 


Polymers 

As noted in Table 19.1, thermal conductivities for most polymers are on the order 
of 0.3 W/m-K. For these materials, energy transfer is accomplished by the vibration 
and rotation of the chain molecules. The magnitude of the thermal conductivity de¬ 
pends on the degree of crystallinity; a polymer with a highly crystalline and ordered 
structure will have a greater conductivity than the equivalent amorphous material. 
This is due to the more effective coordinated vibration of the molecular chains for 
the crystalline state. 

Polymers are often used as thermal insulators because of their low thermal con¬ 
ductivities. As with ceramics, their insulative properties may be further enhanced 
by the introduction of small pores, which are ordinarily introduced by foaming 
(Section 15.18). Foamed polystyrene is commonly used for drinking cups and insu¬ 
lating chests.

19.5 THERMAL STRESSES 

thermal stress Thermal stresses are stresses induced in a body as a result of changes in tempera¬ 

ture. An understanding of the origins and nature of thermal stresses is important 
because these stresses can lead to fracture or undesirable plastic deformation.

Stresses Resulting from Restrained Thermal Expansion 
and Contraction 

Let us first consider a homogeneous and isotropic solid rod that is heated or cooled 
uniformly; that is, no temperature gradients are imposed. For free expansion or con¬ 
traction, the rod will be stress free. If, however, axial motion of the rod is restrained 
by rigid end supports, thermal stresses will be introduced. The magnitude of the 
stress cr resulting from a temperature change from T 0 to T f is 

cr = Eai(T 0 - 7» = Ea t AT (19.8) 

where E is the modulus of elasticity and a , is the linear coefficient of thermal ex¬ 
pansion. Upon heating (T f > T 0 ), the stress is compressive (cr < 0), because rod ex¬ 
pansion has been constrained. Of course, if the rod specimen is cooled {Tf< To), a 
tensile stress will be imposed (a > 0). Also, the stress in Equation 19.8 is the same 
as the stress that would be required to elastically compress (or elongate) the rod

specimen back to its original length after it had been allowed to freely expand (or 
contract) with the T 0 - 7} temperature change. 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 19.1 


Thermal Stress Created upon Heating 

A brass rod is to be used in an application requiring its ends to be held rigid. 
If the rod is stress free at room temperature [20°C (68°F)], what is the maxi¬ 
mum temperature to which the rod may be heated without exceeding a 
compressive stress of 172 MPa (25,000 psi)? Assume a modulus of elasticity 
of 100 GPa (14.6 X 10 6 psi) for brass. 


Solution 

Use Equation 19.8 to solve this problem, where the stress of 172 MPa is taken 
to be negative. Also, the initial temperature T 0 is 20°C, and the magnitude of 
the linear coefficient of thermal expansion from Table 19.1 is 20.0 X 10 -6 
(°C) _1 . Thus, solving for the final temperature T f yields 


T f = 77 —

(100 X 10 3 MPa) [20 X 10- 6 (°C)" 1 ] 
= 20°C + 86°C = 106°C (223°F) 


Stresses Resulting from Temperature Gradients 

When a solid body is heated or cooled, the internal temperature distribution will 
depend on its size and shape, the thermal conductivity of the material, and the rate 
of temperature change. Thermal stresses may be established as a result of temper¬ 
ature gradients across a body, which are frequently caused by rapid heating or 
cooling, in that the outside changes temperature more rapidly than the interior; dif¬ 
ferential dimensional changes restrain the free expansion or contraction of adja¬ 
cent volume elements within the piece. For example, upon heating, the exterior of 
a specimen is hotter and, therefore, will have expanded more than the interior 
regions. Hence, compressive surface stresses are induced and are balanced by ten¬ 
sile interior stresses. The interior-exterior stress conditions are reversed for rapid 
cooling such that the surface is put into a state of tension. 

Thermal Shock of Brittle Materials 

For ductile metals and polymers, alleviation of thermally induced stresses may be 
accomplished by plastic deformation. However, the nonductility of most ceramics 
enhances the possibility of brittle fracture from these stresses. Rapid cooling of a 
brittle body is more likely to inflict such thermal shock than heating, because the 
induced surface stresses are tensile. Crack formation and propagation from surface 
flaws are more probable when an imposed stress is tensile (Section 12.8). 

The capacity of a material to withstand this kind of failure is termed its ther¬ 
mal shock resistance. For a ceramic body that is rapidly cooled, the resistance to 
thermal shock depends not only on the magnitude of the temperature change, but 
also on the mechanical and thermal properties of the material. The thermal shock 
resistance is best for ceramics that have high fracture strengths ay and high thermal 





794 • Chapter 19 / Thermal Properties 


conductivities, as well as low moduli of elasticity and low coefficients of thermal ex¬ 
pansion. The resistance of many materials to this type of failure may be approxi¬ 
mated by a thermal shock resistance parameter TSR : 


Definition of 
thermal shock 
resistance parameter 



(19.9) 


Thermal shock may be prevented by altering the external conditions to the de¬ 
gree that cooling or heating rates are reduced and temperature gradients across a 
body are minimized. Modification of the thermal and/or mechanical characteristics 
in Equation 19.9 may also enhance the thermal shock resistance of a material. Of 
these parameters, the coefficient of thermal expansion is probably most easily 
changed and controlled. For example, common soda-lime glasses, which have an a t 
of approximately 9 X 1CT 6 (°C) _1 , are particularly susceptible to thermal shock, as 
anyone who has baked can probably attest. Reducing the CaO and Na 2 0 contents 
while at the same time adding B 2 0 3 in sufficient quantities to form borosilicate (or 
Pyrex) glass will reduce the coefficient of expansion to about 3 X 10 -6 (°C) _1 ; this 
material is entirely suitable for kitchen oven heating and cooling cycles. The intro¬ 
duction of some relatively large pores or a ductile second phase may also improve 
the thermal shock characteristics of a material; both impede the propagation of 
thermally induced cracks. 

It is often necessary to remove thermal stresses in ceramic materials as a means 
of improving their mechanical strengths and optical characteristics. This may be ac¬ 
complished by an annealing heat treatment, as discussed for glasses in Section 13.9. 


SUMMARY 


Heat Capacity 

• Heat capacity represents the quantity of heat required to produce a unit rise in 
temperature for one mole of a substance; on a per unit mass basis, it is termed 
specific heat. 

• Most of the energy assimilated by many solid materials is associated with 
increasing the vibrational energy of the atoms. 

• Only specific vibrational energy values are allowed (the energy is said to be quan¬ 
tized); a single quantum of vibrational energy is called a phonon. 

• For many crystalline solids and at temperatures within the vicinity of 0 K, the 
heat capacity measured at constant volume varies as the cube of the absolute 
temperature (Equation 19.2). 

• In excess of the Debye temperature, C v becomes temperature independent, as¬ 
suming a value of approximately 3 R. 

Thermal Expansion 

• Solid materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. The fractional 
change in length is proportional to the temperature change, the constant of pro¬ 
portionality being the coefficient of thermal expansion (Equation 19.3). 

• Thermal expansion is reflected by an increase in the average interatomic sepa¬ 
ration, which is a consequence of the asymmetric nature of the potential-energy- 
versus-interatomic-spacing curve trough (Figure 19.3a).The larger the interatomic 
bonding energy, the lower the coefficient of thermal expansion. 



Summary • 795 


• Coefficient-of-thermal-expansion values for polymers are typically greater than 
for metals, which in turn are greater than for ceramic materials. 

Thermal Conductivity 

• The transport of thermal energy from high- to low-temperature regions of a ma¬ 
terial is termed thermal conduction. 

• For steady-state heat transport, flux may be determined using Equation 19.5. 

• For solid materials, heat is transported by free electrons and by vibrational lat¬ 
tice waves, or phonons. 

• The high thermal conductivities for relatively pure metals are due to the large num¬ 
bers of free electrons and the efficiency with which these electrons transport ther¬ 
mal energy. By way of contrast, ceramics and polymers are poor thermal conductors 
because free-electron concentrations are low and phonon conduction predominates. 

Thermal Stresses 

• Thermal stresses, which are introduced in a body as a consequence of tempera¬ 
ture changes, may lead to fracture or undesirable plastic deformation. 

• One source of thermal stresses is the restrained thermal expansion (or contrac¬ 
tion) of a body. Stress magnitude may be computed using Equation 19.8. 

• The generation of thermal stresses resulting from the rapid heating or cooling of 
a body of material result from temperature gradients between the outside and 
interior portions and accompanying differential dimensional changes. 

• Thermal shock is the fracture of a body resulting from thermal stresses induced 
by rapid temperature changes. Because ceramic materials are brittle, they are es¬ 
pecially susceptible to this type of failure.

WHY STUDY the Magnetic Properties of Materials? 


An understanding of the mechanism that explains the 
permanent magnetic behavior of some materials may 
allow us to alter and in some cases tailor the magnetic 


properties. For example, in Design Example 20.1 we 
note how the behavior of a ceramic magnetic mate¬ 
rial may be enhanced by changing its composition.

20.1 INTRODUCTION 

Magnetism, the phenomenon by which materials assert an attractive or repulsive 
force or influence on other materials, has been known for thousands of years. How¬ 
ever, the underlying principles and mechanisms that explain the magnetic phenom¬ 
enon are complex and subtle, and their understanding has eluded scientists until 
relatively recent times. Many of our modern technological devices rely on magnet¬ 
ism and magnetic materials; these include electrical power generators and trans¬ 
formers, electric motors, radio, television, telephones, computers, and components 
of sound and video reproduction systems. 

Iron, some steels, and the naturally occurring mineral lodestone are well-known 
examples of materials that exhibit magnetic properties. Not so familiar, however, is 
the fact that all substances are influenced to one degree or another by the presence 
of a magnetic field. This chapter provides a brief description of the origin of magnetic 
fields and discusses the various magnetic field vectors and magnetic parameters; the 
phenomena of diamagnetism, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, and ferrimagnetism; 
some of the different magnetic materials; and the phenomenon of superconductivity. 

20.2 BASIC CONCEPTS 

Magnetic Dipoles 

Magnetic forces are generated by moving electrically charged particles; these mag¬ 
netic forces are in addition to any electrostatic forces that may prevail. Many times 
it is convenient to think of magnetic forces in terms of fields. Imaginary lines of 
force may be drawn to indicate the direction of the force at positions in the vicin¬ 
ity of the field source. The magnetic field distributions as indicated by lines of force 
are shown for a current loop and also a bar magnet in Figure 20.1. 

Magnetic dipoles are found to exist in magnetic materials, which, in some respects, 
are analogous to electric dipoles (Section 18.19). Magnetic dipoles may be thought 
of as small bar magnets composed of north and south poles instead of positive and 
negative electric charges. In the present discussion, magnetic dipole moments are rep¬ 
resented by arrows, as shown in Figure 20.2. Magnetic dipoles are influenced by

magnetic fields in a manner similar to the way in which electric dipoles are affected 
by electric fields (Figure 18.30). Within a magnetic field, the force of the field itself 
exerts a torque that tends to orient the dipoles with the field. A familiar example is 
the way in which a magnetic compass needle lines up with the earth’s magnetic field. 

Magnetic Field Vectors 

Before discussing the origin of magnetic moments in solid materials, we describe 
magnetic behavior in terms of several field vectors. The externally applied magnetic 
field, sometimes called the magnetic field strength, is designated by H. If the mag¬ 
netic field is generated by means of a cylindrical coil (or solenoid) consisting of N 
closely spaced turns, having a length /, and carrying a current of magnitude /, then 

NI 

H = — (20.1) 

A schematic diagram of such an arrangement is shown in Figure 20.3a. The magnetic 
field that is generated by the current loop and the bar magnet in Figure 20.1 is an 
H field. The units of H are ampere-turns per meter, or just amperes per meter. 

The magnetic induction, or magnetic flux density, denoted by B , represents the 
magnitude of the internal field strength within a substance that is subjected to an 
H field. The units for B are teslas [or webers per square meter (Wb/m 2 )]. Both B 
and H are field vectors, being characterized not only by magnitude, but also by 
direction in space.

20.2 Basic Concepts * 803 



Figure 20.3 (a) The magnetic field H as generated by a cylindrical coil is dependent on 
the current /, the number of turns N, and the coil length /, according to Equation 20.1. The 
magnetic flux density B 0 in the presence of a vacuum is equal to /jl 0 H , where /i 0 is the 
permeability of a vacuum, 4 it X 10 -7 H/m. ( b ) The magnetic flux density B within a solid 
material is equal to /jlH , where fi is the permeability of the solid material. (Adapted from

The magnetic field strength and flux density are related according to 


B = [jlH (20.2) 

The parameter /jl is called the permeability, which is a property of the specific 
medium through which the H field passes and in which B is measured, as illustrated 
in Figure 20.3 b. The permeability has dimensions of webers per ampere-meter 
(Wb/A*m) or henries per meter (H/m). 

In a vacuum,

where p 0 is the permeability of a vacuum, a universal constant, which has a value 
of 477 X 10 -7 (1.257 X 10 -6 ) H/m. The parameter B 0 represents the flux density 
within a vacuum as demonstrated in Figure 20.3a. 

Several parameters may be used to describe the magnetic properties of solids. 
One of these is the ratio of the permeability in a material to the permeability in a 
vacuum, or

where n r is called the relative permeability, which is unitless. The permeability or 
relative permeability of a material is a measure of the degree to which the mate¬ 
rial can be magnetized, or the ease with which a B field can be induced in the pres¬ 
ence of an external H field. 

Another field quantity, M , called the magnetization of the solid, is defined by 
the expression 


B = plqH + p, 0 M (20.5) 

In the presence of an H field, the magnetic moments within a material tend to be¬ 
come aligned with the field and to reinforce it by virtue of their magnetic fields; 
the term p, 0 M in Equation 20.5 is a measure of this contribution.

The magnitude of M is proportional to the applied field as follows:

and Xm i s called the magnetic susceptibility, which is unitless. 1 The magnetic suscep¬ 
tibility and the relative permeability are related as follows: 

Xm = Mr “ 1 (20.7) 

There is a dielectric analogue for each of the foregoing magnetic field param¬ 
eters. The B and H fields are, respectively, analogous to the dielectric displacement 
D and the electric field % whereas the permeability jul parallels the permittivity e 
(cf. Equations 20.2 and 18.30). Furthermore, the magnetization M and polarization 
P are correlates (Equations 20.5 and 18.31). 

Magnetic units may be a source of confusion because there are really two 
systems in common use. The ones used thus far are SI [rationalized MKS (meter- 
kilogram-second)]; the others come from the cgs-emu (centimeter-gram-second- 
electromagnetic unit) system. The units for both systems as well as the appropriate 
conversion factors are contained in Table 20.1. 


Origins of Magnetic Moments 

The macroscopic magnetic properties of materials are a consequence of magnetic 
moments associated with individual electrons. Some of these concepts are relatively 
complex and involve some quantum-mechanical principles beyond the scope of this 
discussion; consequently, simplifications have been made and some of the details 
omitted. Each electron in an atom has magnetic moments that originate from two 
sources. One is related to its orbital motion around the nucleus; being a moving 


1 This Xm is taken to be the volume susceptibility in SI units, which, when multiplied by H , 
yields the magnetization per unit volume (cubic meter) of material. Other susceptibilities 
are also possible; see Problem 20.3.

charge, an electron may be considered to be a small current loop, generating a very 
small magnetic field, and having a magnetic moment along its axis of rotation, as 
schematically illustrated in Figure 20.4a. 

Each electron may also be thought of as spinning around an axis; the other 
magnetic moment originates from this electron spin, which is directed along the 
spin axis as shown in Figure 20.4Z?. Spin magnetic moments may be only in an “up” 
direction or in an antiparallel “down” direction. Thus each electron in an atom may 
be thought of as being a small magnet having permanent orbital and spin magnetic 
moments. 

Bohr magneton The most fundamental magnetic moment is the Bohr magneton /jl b , which is 

of magnitude 9.27 X 1CT 24 A*m 2 . For each electron in an atom the spin magnetic 
moment is d=/x B (plus for spin up, minus for spin down). Furthermore, the orbital 
magnetic moment contribution is equal to being the magnetic quantum 

number of the electron, as mentioned in Section 2.3. 

In each individual atom, orbital moments of some electron pairs cancel each 
other; this also holds for the spin moments. For example, the spin moment of an 
electron with spin up will cancel that of one with spin down. The net magnetic mo¬ 
ment, then, for an atom is just the sum of the magnetic moments of each of the 
constituent electrons, including both orbital and spin contributions, and taking into 
account moment cancellation. For an atom having completely filled electron shells 
or subshells, when all electrons are considered, there is total cancellation of both 
orbital and spin moments. Thus materials composed of atoms having completely 
filled electron shells are not capable of being permanently magnetized. This cate¬ 
gory includes the inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.) as well as some ionic materials. The 
types of magnetism include diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and ferromagnetism; in 
addition, antiferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism are considered to be subclasses 
of ferromagnetism. All materials exhibit at least one of these types, and the behav¬ 
ior depends on the response of electron and atomic magnetic dipoles to the appli¬ 
cation of an externally applied magnetic field. 

20.3 DIAMAGNETISM AND PARAMAGNETISM 

diamagnetism Diamagnetism is a very weak form of magnetism that is nonpermanent and persists 

only while an external field is being applied. It is induced by a change in the orbital 
motion of electrons due to an applied magnetic field. The magnitude of the induced 
magnetic moment is extremely small, and in a direction opposite to that of the ap¬ 
plied field. Thus, the relative permeability /x r is less than unity (however, only very 
slightly), and the magnetic susceptibility is negative; that is, the magnitude of the B 
field within a diamagnetic solid is less than that in a vacuum. The volume suscep¬ 
tibility Xm f° r diamagnetic solid materials is on the order of -1CT 5 . When placed 
between the poles of a strong electromagnet, diamagnetic materials are attracted 
toward regions where the field is weak.

Figure 20.5a illustrates schematically the atomic magnetic dipole configura¬ 
tions for a diamagnetic material with and without an external field; here, the ar¬ 
rows represent atomic dipole moments, whereas for the preceding discussion, 
arrows denoted only electron moments. The dependence of B on the external field 
H for a material that exhibits diamagnetic behavior is presented in Figure 20.6. 
Table 20.2 gives the susceptibilities of several diamagnetic materials. Diamagnetism 
is found in all materials, but because it is so weak, it can be observed only when 
other types of magnetism are totally absent. This form of magnetism is of no 
practical importance. 

For some solid materials, each atom possesses a permanent dipole moment by 
virtue of incomplete cancellation of electron spin and/or orbital magnetic moments. 
In the absence of an external magnetic field, the orientations of these atomic mag¬ 
netic moments are random, such that a piece of material possesses no net macro¬ 
scopic magnetization. These atomic dipoles are free to rotate, and paramagnetism 
results when they preferentially align, by rotation, with an external field as shown 
in Figure 20.5 b. These magnetic dipoles are acted on individually with no mutual

interaction between adjacent dipoles. Inasmuch as the dipoles align with the exter¬ 
nal field, they enhance it, giving rise to a relative permeability \x r that is greater than 
unity, and to a relatively small but positive magnetic susceptibility. Susceptibilities 
for paramagnetic materials range from about 10 -5 to 10 -2 (Table 20.2). A schematic 
5-versus-// curve for a paramagnetic material is also shown in Figure 20.6. 

Both diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials are considered nonmagnetic be¬ 
cause they exhibit magnetization only when in the presence of an external field. 
Also, for both, the flux density B within them is almost the same as it would be in 
a vacuum.

magnetization 


Certain metallic materials possess a permanent magnetic moment in the absence 
of an external field, and manifest very large and permanent magnetizations. These 
are the characteristics of ferromagnetism, and they are displayed by the transi¬ 
tion metals iron (as BCC a-ferrite), cobalt, nickel, and some of the rare earth met¬ 
als such as gadolinium (Gd). Magnetic susceptibilities as high as 10 6 are possible 
for ferromagnetic materials. Consequently, H M, and from Equation 20.5 we 
write 


B = iul 0 M (20.8) 

Permanent magnetic moments in ferromagnetic materials result from atomic 
magnetic moments due to uncancelled electron spins as a consequence of the elec¬ 
tron structure. There is also an orbital magnetic moment contribution that is small 
in comparison to the spin moment. Furthermore, in a ferromagnetic material, cou¬ 
pling interactions cause net spin magnetic moments of adjacent atoms to align with 
one another, even in the absence of an external field. This is schematically illustrated 
in Figure 20.7. The origin of these coupling forces is not completely understood, but 
it is thought to arise from the electronic structure of the metal. This mutual spin 
alignment exists over relatively large-volume regions of the crystal called domains 
(see Section 20.7). 

The maximum possible magnetization, or saturation magnetization M s , of a 
ferromagnetic material represents the magnetization that results when all the 
magnetic dipoles in a solid piece are mutually aligned with the external field; there

is also a corresponding saturation flux density B s . The saturation magnetization is 
equal to the product of the net magnetic moment for each atom and the number 
of atoms present. For each of iron, cobalt, and nickel, the net magnetic moments 
per atom are 2.22,1.72, and 0.60 Bohr magnetons, respectively.

Saturation Magnetization and Flux Density Computations 
for Nickel 

Calculate (a) the saturation magnetization and (b) the saturation flux density 
for nickel, which has a density of 8.90 g/cm 3 . 

Solution 

(a) The saturation magnetization is just the product of the number of Bohr 
magnetons per atom (0.60 as given earlier), the magnitude of the Bohr 
magneton p, B , and the number N of atoms per cubic meter, or 


M s = 0.60 iul b N (20.9) 

Now, the number of atoms per cubic meter is related to the density p, the 
atomic weight and Avogadro’s number N A , as follows:

20.5 ANTIFERROMAGNETISM AND 
FERRIMAGNETISM 

Antiferromagnetism 

This phenomenon of magnetic moment coupling between adjacent atoms or ions 
occurs in materials other than those that are ferromagnetic. In one such group, this 
coupling results in an antiparallel alignment; the alignment of the spin moments of 
antiferromagnetism neighboring atoms or ions in exactly opposite directions is termed antiferromag¬ 
netism. Manganese oxide (MnO) is one material that displays this behavior. Man¬ 
ganese oxide is a ceramic material that is ionic in character, having both Mn 2+ and 
O 2- ions. No net magnetic moment is associated with the O 2- ions, because there is 
a total cancellation of both spin and orbital moments. However, the Mn 2+ ions pos¬ 
sess a net magnetic moment that is predominantly of spin origin. These Mn 2+ ions 
are arrayed in the crystal structure such that the moments of adjacent ions are an¬ 
tiparallel. This arrangement is represented schematically in Figure 20.8. Obviously, 
the opposing magnetic moments cancel one another, and, as a consequence, the 
solid as a whole possesses no net magnetic moment. 

Ferrimagnetism 

ferrimagnetism Some ceramics also exhibit a permanent magnetization, termed ferrimagnetism. The 

macroscopic magnetic characteristics of ferromagnets and ferrimagnets are similar; 
the distinction lies in the source of the net magnetic moments. The principles of fer¬ 
rimagnetism are illustrated with the cubic ferrites. 2 These ionic materials may be 
represented by the chemical formula MFe 2 0 4 , in which M represents any one of 
several metallic elements. The prototype ferrite is Fe 3 0 4 , the mineral magnetite, 
sometimes called lodestone. 

The formula for Fe 3 0 4 may be written as Fe 2+ 0 2_ -(Fe 3+ ) 2 (0 2_ ) 3 , in which the 
Fe ions exist in both +2 and +3 valence states in the ratio of 1:2. A net spin mag¬ 
netic moment exists for each Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ion, which corresponds to 4 and 5 Bohr 
magnetons, respectively, for the two ion types. Furthermore, the O 2- ions are mag¬ 
netically neutral. There are antiparallel spin-coupling interactions between the Fe 
ions, similar in character to antiferromagnetism. However, the net ferrimagnetic 
moment arises from the incomplete cancellation of spin moments. 

Cubic ferrites have the inverse spinel crystal structure, which is cubic in sym¬ 
metry, and similar to the spinel structure (Section 12.2). (A unit cell for this inverse 
spinel structure is shown on the front cover of the book. Red spheres represent 


2 Ferrite in the magnetic sense should not be confused with the ferrite a-iron discussed in 
Section 9.18; in the remainder of this chapter, the term ferrite implies the magnetic ceramic.

tively.) The inverse spinel crystal structure might be thought of as having been gener¬ 
ated by the stacking of close-packed planes of O 2- ions. Again, there are two types of 
positions that may be occupied by the iron cations, as illustrated in Figure 12.7. For 
one, the coordination number is 4 (tetrahedral coordination); that is, each Fe ion is 
surrounded by four oxygen nearest neighbors. For the other, the coordination number 
is 6 (octahedral coordination). With this inverse spinel structure, half the trivalent (Fe 3+ ) 
ions are situated in octahedral positions, and the other half in tetrahedral positions. 
The divalent Fe 2+ ions are all located in octahedral positions. (The occupancy of tetra¬ 
hedral and octahedral positions by Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ ions within close-packed planes of 
O 2- ions, as well as their relationship to the inverse spinel unit cell are represented on 
the book’s back cover.) The critical factor is the arrangement of the spin moments of 
the Fe ions, as represented in Figure 20.9 and Table 20.3. The spin moments of all the 
Fe 3+ ions in the octahedral positions are aligned parallel to one another; however, they 
are directed oppositely to the Fe 3+ ions disposed in the tetrahedral positions, which 
are also aligned. This results from the antiparallel coupling of adjacent iron ions. Thus, 
the spin moments of all Fe 3+ ions cancel one another and make no net contribution 
to the magnetization of the solid. All the Fe 2+ ions have their moments aligned in the 
same direction; this total moment is responsible for the net magnetization (see Table 
20.3). Thus, the saturation magnetization of a ferrimagnetic solid may be computed 
from the product of the net spin magnetic moment for each Fe 2+ ion and the num¬ 
ber of Fe 2+ ions; this would correspond to the mutual alignment of all the Fe 2+ ion 
magnetic moments in the Fe 3 0 4 specimen.

Cubic ferrites having other compositions may be produced by adding metallic ions 
that substitute for some of the iron in the crystal structure. Again, from the ferrite 
chemical formula, M 2+ 0 2_ -(Fe 3+ ) 2 (0 2_ ) 3 , in addition to Fe 2+ , M 2+ may represent di¬ 
valent ions such as Ni 2+ , Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Cu 2+ , each of which possesses a net spin 
magnetic moment different from 4; several are listed in Table 20.4. Thus, by adjustment 
of composition, ferrite compounds having a range of magnetic properties may be pro¬ 
duced. For example, nickel ferrite has the formula NiFe 2 0 4 . Other compounds may 
also be produced containing mixtures of two divalent metal ions such as (Mn,Mg)Fe 2 0 4 , 
in which the Mn 2+ :Mg 2+ ratio may be varied; these are called mixed ferrites . 

Ceramic materials other than the cubic ferrites are also ferrimagnetic; these in¬ 
clude the hexagonal ferrites and garnets. Hexagonal ferrites have a crystal struc¬ 
ture similar to the inverse spinel, with hexagonal symmetry rather than cubic. The 
chemical formula for these materials may be represented by AB 12 0 19 , in which A 
is a divalent metal such as barium, lead, or strontium, and B is a trivalent metal 
such as aluminum, gallium, chromium, or iron. The two most common examples of 
the hexagonal ferrites are PbFe 12 0 19 and BaFe 12 0 19 . 

The garnets have a very complicated crystal structure, which may be repre¬ 
sented by the general formula M 3 Fe 5 0 12 ; here, M represents a rare earth ion such 
as samarium, europium, gadolinium, or yttrium. Yttrium iron garnet (Y 3 Fe 5 0 12 ), 
sometimes denoted YIG, is the most common material of this type. 

The saturation magnetizations for ferrimagnetic materials are not as high as for 
ferromagnets. On the other hand, ferrites, being ceramic materials, are good elec¬ 
trical insulators. For some magnetic applications, such as high-frequency transform¬ 
ers, a low electrical conductivity is most desirable.

material (Fe 3 0 4 ) 


Computation of the 
number of Bohr 
magnetons per unit 
cell 


EXAMPLE PROBLEM 20.2 


Saturation Magnetization Determination for Fe 3 0 4 

Calculate the saturation magnetization for Fe 3 0 4 given that each cubic unit 
cell contains 8 Fe 2+ and 16 Fe 3+ ions, and that the unit cell edge length is 
0.839 nm. 

Solution 

This problem is solved in a manner similar to Example Problem 20.1, except 
that the computational basis is per unit cell as opposed to per atom or ion. 

The saturation magnetization will be equal to the product of the number 
N' of Bohr magnetons per cubic meter of Fe 3 0 4 , and the magnetic moment 
per Bohr magneton 


M s = N'n B (20.11) 

Now, N' is just the number of Bohr magnetons per unit cell n B divided by the 
unit cell volume V c , or 


N' = 


Kb 

Vc 


( 20 . 12 ) 


Again, the net magnetization results from the Fe 2+ ions only. Because there 
are 8 Fe 2+ ions per unit cell and 4 Bohr magnetons per Fe 2+ ion, n B is 32. 
Furthermore, the unit cell is a cube, and V c = a 3 , a being the unit cell edge 
length. Therefore.

Design a cubic mixed-ferrite magnetic material that has a saturation magnetiza¬ 
tion of 5.25 X 10 5 A/m. 


Solution 

According to Example Problem 20.2, the saturation magnetization for Fe 3 0 4 is 
5.0 X 10 5 A/m. In order to increase the magnitude of M s it is necessary to re¬ 
place some fraction of the Fe 2+ with a divalent metal ion that has a greater mag¬ 
netic moment—for example Mn 2+ ; from Table 20.4, note that there are 5 Bohr 
magnetons/Mn 2+ ion as compared to 4 Bohr magnetons/Fe 2+ . Let us first employ 
Equation 20.13 to compute the number of Bohr magnetons per unit cell (w B ),

assuming that the Mn 2+ addition does not change the unit cell edge length (0.839 
nm). Thus,

9.27 X 10 _24 A-m 2 /Bohr magneton 
= 33.45 Bohr magnetons/unit cell 

If we let x represent the fraction of Mn 2+ that have substituted for Fe 2+ , then the 
remaining unsubstituted Fe 2+ fraction is equal to (1 — x). Furthermore, inasmuch 
as there are 8 divalent ions per unit cell, we may write the following expression: 

8[5% + 4(1 - x)] = 33.45 

which leads to x = 0.181. Thus, if 18.1 at% of the Fe 2+ in Fe 3 0 4 are replaced with 
Mn 2+ , the saturation magnetization will be increased to 5.25 X 10 5 A/m. 



20.6 THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE 
ON MAGNETIC BEHAVIOR 

Temperature can also influence the magnetic characteristics of materials. Recall that 
raising the temperature of a solid results in an increase in the magnitude of the 
thermal vibrations of atoms. The atomic magnetic moments are free to rotate; hence, 
with rising temperature, the increased thermal motion of the atoms tends to ran¬ 
domize the directions of any moments that may be aligned. 

For ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic materials, the atomic 
thermal motions counteract the coupling forces between the adjacent atomic dipole 
moments, causing some dipole misalignment, regardless of whether an external field 
is present. This results in a decrease in the saturation magnetization for both ferro- 
and ferrimagnets. The saturation magnetization is a maximum at 0 K, at which tem¬ 
perature the thermal vibrations are a minimum. With increasing temperature, the 
saturation magnetization diminishes gradually and then abruptly drops to zero at 
Curie temperature what is called the Curie temperature T c . The magnetization-temperature behavior 
for iron and Fe 3 0 4 is represented in Figure 20.10. At T c the mutual spin-coupling 
forces are completely destroyed, such that for temperatures above T c both ferro¬ 
magnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are paramagnetic. The magnitude of the Curie 
temperature varies from material to material; for example, for iron, cobalt, nickel, 
and Fe 3 0 4 , the respective values are 768,1120, 335, and 585°C. 

Antiferromagnetism is also affected by temperature; this behavior vanishes at what 
is called the Neel temperature. At temperatures above this point, antiferromagnetic 
materials also become paramagnetic.

20.7 DOMAINS AND HYSTERESIS 

Any ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material that is at a temperature below T c is 
composed of small-volume regions in which there is a mutual alignment in the same 
direction of all magnetic dipole moments, as illustrated in Figure 20.11. Such a re¬ 
gion is called a domain, and each one is magnetized to its saturation magnetization. 
Adjacent domains are separated by domain boundaries or walls, across which the 
direction of magnetization gradually changes (Figure 20.12). Normally, domains are 
microscopic in size, and for a polycrystalline specimen, each grain may consist of 
more than a single domain. Thus, in a macroscopic piece of material, there will be 
a large number of domains, and all may have different magnetization orientations. 
The magnitude of the M field for the entire solid is the vector sum of the magne¬ 
tizations of all the domains, each domain contribution being weighted by its vol¬ 
ume fraction. For an unmagnetized specimen, the appropriately weighted vector 
sum of the magnetizations of all the domains is zero.

ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material; arrows represent 
atomic magnetic dipoles. Within each domain, all dipoles are 
aligned, whereas the direction of alignment varies from one 
domain to another.

Flux density B and field intensity H are not proportional for ferromagnets and 
ferrimagnets. If the material is initially unmagnetized, then B varies as a function 
of H , as shown in Figure 20.13. The curve begins at the origin, and as H is increased, 
the B field begins to increase slowly, then more rapidly, finally leveling off and be¬ 
coming independent of H. This maximum value of B is the saturation flux density B s , 
and the corresponding magnetization is the saturation magnetization M s , mentioned 
previously. Because the permeability p from Equation 20.2 is the slope of the 
B-versus-H curve, note from Figure 20.13 that the permeability changes with and 
is dependent on H. On occasion, the slope of the ZUversus-// curve at H = 0 is spec¬ 
ified as a material property, which is termed the initial permeability p h as indicated 
in Figure 20.13. 

As an H field is applied, the domains change shape and size by the movement 
of domain boundaries. Schematic domain structures are represented in the insets 
(labeled U through Z) at several points along the 5-versus-// curve in Figure 20.13. 
Initially, the moments of the constituent domains are randomly oriented such that 
there is no net B (or M ) field (inset U). As the external field is applied, the domains 
that are oriented in directions favorable to (or nearly aligned with) the applied field

grow at the expense of those that are unfavorably oriented (insets V through X). 
This process continues with increasing field strength until the macroscopic specimen 
becomes a single domain, which is nearly aligned with the field (inset Y). Saturation 
is achieved when this domain, by means of rotation, becomes oriented with the H 
field (inset Z). 

From saturation, point S in Figure 20.14, as the H field is reduced by reversal 
of field direction, the curve does not retrace its original path. A hysteresis effect is 
produced in which the B field lags behind the applied H field, or decreases at a 
lower rate. At zero H field (point R on the curve), there exists a residual B field 
that is called the remanence, or remanent flux density , B n the material remains mag¬ 
netized in the absence of an external H field. 

Hysteresis behavior and permanent magnetization may be explained by the mo¬ 
tion of domain walls. Upon reversal of the field direction from saturation (point S 
in Figure 20.14), the process by which the domain structure changes is reversed. 
First, there is a rotation of the single domain with the reversed field. Next, do¬ 
mains having magnetic moments aligned with the new field form and grow at the 
expense of the former domains. Critical to this explanation is the resistance to 
movement of domain walls that occurs in response to the increase of the mag¬ 
netic field in the opposite direction; this accounts for the lag of B with H , or the 
hysteresis. When the applied field reaches zero, there is still some net volume frac¬ 
tion of domains oriented in the former direction, which explains the existence of 
the remanence B r . 

To reduce the B field within the specimen to zero (point C on Figure 20.14), 
an H field of magnitude -H c must be applied in a direction opposite to that of the 
original field; H c is called the coercivity, or sometimes the coercive force. Upon con¬ 
tinuation of the applied field in this reverse direction, as indicated in the figure, sat¬ 
uration is ultimately achieved in the opposite sense, corresponding to point S'. A 
second reversal of the field to the point of the initial saturation (point S ) completes 
the symmetrical hysteresis loop and also yields both a negative remanence (~B r ) 
and a positive coercivity (+H C ). 

The 5-versus-H curve in Figure 20.14 represents a hysteresis loop taken to sat¬ 
uration. Of course, it is not necessary to increase the H field to saturation before 
reversing the field direction; in Figure 20.15, loop NP is a hysteresis curve corre¬ 
sponding to less than saturation. Furthermore, it is possible to reverse the direction

of the field at any point along the curve and generate other hysteresis loops. One 
such loop is indicated on the saturation curve in Figure 20.15: for loop LM, the 
H field is reversed to zero. One method of demagnetizing a ferromagnet or ferri- 
magnet is to repeatedly cycle it in an H field that alternates direction and decreases 
in magnitude. 

At this point it is instructive to compare the 5-versus-// behaviors of para¬ 
magnetic, diamagnetic, and ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic materials; such a compar¬ 
ison is shown in Figure 20.16. The linearity of paramagnetic and diamagnetic 
materials may be noted in the small inset plot, whereas the behavior of a typical 
ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic is nonlinear. Furthermore, the rationale for labeling 
paramagnetics and diamagnetics as nonmagnetic materials is verified by compar¬ 
ing the B scales on the vertical axes of the two plots—at an H field strength of

20.8 MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY 

The magnetic hysteresis curves discussed in the previous section will have different 
shapes depending on various factors: (1) whether the specimen is a single crystal or 
poly crystalline; (2) if polycrystalline, any preferred orientation of the grains; (3) the 
presence of pores or second-phase particles; and (4) other factors such as temper¬ 
ature and, if a mechanical stress is applied, the stress state. 

For example, the B (or M ) versus H curve for a single crystal of a ferromag¬ 
netic material depends on its crystallographic orientation relative to the direction 
of the applied H field. This behavior is demonstrated in Figure 20.17 for single 



Figure 20.17 Magnetization

(HCP) in [0001] and [10T0]/[1120] directions. This dependence of magnetic behav¬ 
ior on crystallographic orientation is termed magnetic (or sometimes magnetocrys¬ 
talline) anisotropy. 

For each of these materials there is one crystallographic direction in which mag¬ 
netization is easiest—that is, saturation (of M ) is achieved at the lowest H field; this 
is termed a direction of easy magnetization. For example, for Ni (Figure 20.17) this 
direction is [111] inasmuch as saturation occurs at point A; whereas, for [110] and 
[100] orientations, saturation points correspond, respectively, to points B and C. Cor¬ 
respondingly, easy magnetization directions for Fe and Co are [100] and [0001], re¬ 
spectively (Figures 20.17 and 20.18). Conversely, a hard crystallographic direction 
is that direction for which saturation magnetization is most difficult; hard directions 
for Ni, Fe, and Co are [100], [111], and [10T0]/[1120]. 

As noted in the previous section, the insets of Figure 20.13 represent domain 
configurations at various stages along the B (or M) versus H curve during the mag¬ 
netization of a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic material. Here, each of the arrows rep¬ 
resents a domain’s direction of easy magnetization; domains whose directions of 
easy magnetization are most closely aligned with the H field grow, at the expense 
of the other domains that shrink (insets V through X). Furthermore, the magneti¬ 
zation of the single domain in inset Y also corresponds to an easy direction. And 
saturation is achieved as the direction of this domain rotates away from the easy 
direction into the direction of the applied field (inset Z). 


20.9 SOFT MAGNETIC MATERIALS 

The size and shape of the hysteresis curve for ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic mate¬ 
rials is of considerable practical importance. The area within a loop represents a mag¬ 
netic energy loss per unit volume of material per magnetization-demagnetization 
cycle; this energy loss is manifested as heat that is generated within the magnetic 
specimen and is capable of raising its temperature.

Both ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are classified as either soft or 
hard on the basis of their hysteresis characteristics. Soft magnetic materials are used 
in devices that are subjected to alternating magnetic fields and in which energy 
losses must be low; one familiar example consists of transformer cores. For this rea¬ 
son the relative area within the hysteresis loop must be small; it is characteristically 
thin and narrow, as represented in Figure 20.19. Consequently, a soft magnetic ma¬ 
terial must have a high initial permeability and a low coercivity. A material possess¬ 
ing these properties may reach its saturation magnetization with a relatively low 
applied field (i.e., is easily magnetized and demagnetized) and still has low hystere¬ 
sis energy losses. 

The saturation field or magnetization is determined only by the composition of 
the material. For example, in cubic ferrites, substitution of a divalent metal ion such 
as Ni 2+ for Fe 2+ in Fe0-Fe 2 0 3 will change the saturation magnetization. However, 
susceptibility and coercivity (// c ), which also influence the shape of the hysteresis 
curve, are sensitive to structural variables rather than to composition. For example, 
a low value of coercivity corresponds to the easy movement of domain walls as the 
magnetic field changes magnitude and/or direction. Structural defects such as par¬ 
ticles of a nonmagnetic phase or voids in the magnetic material tend to restrict the 
motion of domain walls, and thus increase the coercivity. Consequently, a soft mag¬ 
netic material must be free of such structural defects. 

Another property consideration for soft magnetic materials is electrical resis¬ 
tivity. In addition to the hysteresis energy losses described previously, energy losses 
may result from electrical currents that are induced in a magnetic material by a 
magnetic field that varies in magnitude and direction with time; these are called 
eddy currents. It is most desirable to minimize these energy losses in soft magnetic 
materials by increasing the electrical resistivity. This is accomplished in ferromag¬ 
netic materials by forming solid solution alloys; iron-silicon and iron-nickel alloys 
are examples. The ceramic ferrites are commonly used for applications requiring 
soft magnetic materials because they are intrinsically electrical insulators. Their ap¬ 
plicability is somewhat limited, however, inasmuch as they have relatively small 








20.9 Soft Magnetic Materials * 821 


MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

An Iron-Silicon Alloy That Is Used in Transformer Cores 


A s mentioned earlier in this section, trans¬ 
former cores require the use of soft magnetic 
materials, which are easily magnetized and de¬ 
magnetized (and also have relatively high electri¬ 
cal resistivities). One alloy commonly used for this 
application is the iron-silicon alloy listed in Table 
20.5 (97 wt% Fe-3 wt% Si). Single crystals of this 
alloy are magnetically anisotropic, as are also sin¬ 
gle crystals of iron (as explained previously). Con¬ 
sequently, energy losses of transformers could be 
minimized if their cores were fabricated from sin¬ 
gle crystals such that a [100]-type direction [the 
direction of easy magnetization (Figure 20.17)] is 
oriented parallel to the direction of an applied 
magnetic field; this configuration for a trans¬ 
former core is represented schematically in Fig¬ 
ure 20.20. Unfortunately, single crystals are 
expensive to prepare, and, thus, this is an econom¬ 
ically unpractical situation. A better alternative — 
one that is used commercially, being more 
economically attractive—is to fabricate cores from 
polycrystalline sheets of this alloy that are 
anisotropic. 

It is often the case that the grains in polycrys¬ 
talline materials are randomly oriented, with the 
result that their properties are isotropic (Section 
3.15). However, one way of developing anisotropy 


in polycrystalline metals is via plastic deformation, 
for example by rolling (Section 11.4, Figure 11.85); 
rolling is the technique by which sheet transformer 
cores are fabricated. A flat sheet that has been 
rolled is said to have a rolling (or sheet) texture , or 
there is a preferred crystallographic orientation of 
the grains. For this type of texture, during the 
rolling operation, for most of the grains in the 
sheet, a specific crystallographic plane (hkl) be¬ 
comes is aligned parallel (or nearly parallel) to the 
surface of the sheet, and, in addition a direction 
[uvw] in that plane lies parallel (or nearly paral¬ 
lel) to the rolling direction. Thus, a rolling texture 
is indicated by the plane-direction combination, 
( hkl)[uvw ]. For body-centered cubic alloys (to in¬ 
clude the iron-silicon alloy mentioned earlier), the 
rolling texture is (110) [001], which is represented 
schematically in Figure 20.21. Thus, transformer 
cores of this iron-silicon alloy are fabricated so 
that the direction in which the sheet was rolled 
(corresponding to a [001]-type direction for most 
of the grains) is aligned parallel to the direction 
of the magnetic field application. 3 

The magnetic characteristics of this alloy may 
be further improved through a series of deforma¬ 
tion and heat-treating procedures that produce a 
(100) [001] texture.

core, including the direction of the B field that is

(110) [001] rolling texture for body-centered cubic iron. 


3 For body-centered cubic metals and alloys, [100] and [001] directions are equivalent (Section 3.9)—that is, both 
are directions of easy magnetization.

susceptibilities. The properties of a half-dozen soft magnetic materials are shown in 
Table 20.5. 

The hysteresis characteristics of soft magnetic materials may be enhanced for some 
applications by an appropriate heat treatment in the presence of a magnetic field. 
Using such a technique, a square hysteresis loop may be produced, which is desirable 
in some magnetic amplifier and pulse transformer applications. In addition, soft mag¬ 
netic materials are used in generators, motors, dynamos, and switching circuits. 


20.10 HARD MAGNETIC MATERIALS 

Hard magnetic materials are used in permanent magnets, which must have a high 
hard magnetic resistance to demagnetization. In terms of hysteresis behavior, a hard magnetic 

material material has a high remanence, coercivity, and saturation flux density, as well as a 

low initial permeability and high hysteresis energy losses. The hysteresis character¬ 
istics for hard and soft magnetic materials are compared in Figure 20.19. The two 
most important characteristics relative to applications for these materials are the 
coercivity and what is termed the energy product, designated as (BH) max . This 
(BH) max corresponds to the area of the largest B-H rectangle that can be constructed 
within the second quadrant of the hysteresis curve, Figure 20.22; its units are kJ/m 3 
(MGOe). 4 The value of the energy product is representative of the energy required 
to demagnetize a permanent magnet; that is, the larger ( BH ) max , the harder the 
material in terms of its magnetic characteristics. 


4 MGOe is defined as 

1 MGOe = 10 6 gauss-oersted 

Furthermore, conversion from cgs-emu to SI units is accomplished by the relationship 

1 MGOe = 7.96 kJ/m 3 






20.10 Hard Magnetic Materials * 823

magnetization curve that 
displays hysteresis. Within 
the second quadrant are 
drawn two B-H energy 
product rectangles; the area 
of the rectangle labeled 
(#//) max is the largest 
possible, which is greater 
than the area defined by 
B<rH d . 


Again, hysteresis behavior is related to the ease with which the magnetic do¬ 
main boundaries move; by impeding domain wall motion, the coercivity and sus¬ 
ceptibility are enhanced, such that a large external field is required for demagnet¬ 
ization. Furthermore, these characteristics are interrelated to the microstructure of 
the material. 


Concept 


Check 20.6 


It is possible, by various means (i.e., alteration of microstructure and impurity ad¬ 
ditions), to control the ease with which domain walls move as the magnetic field is 
changed for ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. Sketch a schematic 5-versus-H 
hysteresis loop for a ferromagnetic material, and superimpose on this plot the loop 
alterations that would occur if domain boundary movement were hindered. 


[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site.)] 


Conventional Hard Magnetic Materials 

Hard magnetic materials fall within two main categories—conventional and high 
energy. The conventional materials have ( BH) max values that range between about 
2 and 80 kJ/m 3 (0.25 and 10 MGOe). These include ferromagnetic materials—magnet 
steels, cunife (Cu-Ni-Fe) alloys, alnico (Al-Ni-Co) alloys—as well as the hexagonal 
ferrites (Ba0-6Fe 2 0 3 ). Table 20.6 presents some of the critical properties of several 
of these hard magnetic materials. 

The hard magnet steels are normally alloyed with tungsten and/or chromium. 
Under the proper heat-treating conditions these two elements readily combine with 
carbon in the steel to form tungsten and chromium carbide precipitate particles, 
which are especially effective in obstructing domain wall motion. For the other metal

alloys, an appropriate heat treatment forms extremely small single-domain and 
strongly magnetic iron-cobalt particles within a nonmagnetic matrix phase. 

High-Energy Hard Magnetic Materials 

Permanent magnetic materials having energy products in excess of about 80 kJ/m 3 
(10 MGOe) are considered to be of the high-energy type. These are recently devel¬ 
oped intermetallic compounds that have a variety of compositions; the two that 
have found commercial exploitation are SmCo 5 and Nd 2 Fe 14 B. Their magnetic prop¬ 
erties are also listed in Table 20.6. 

Samarium-Cobalt Magnets 

SmCo 5 is a member of a group of alloys that are combinations of cobalt or iron and 
a light rare earth element; a number of these alloys exhibit high-energy, hard mag¬ 
netic behavior, but SmCo 5 is the only one of commercial significance. The energy 
product of these SmCo 5 materials [between 120 and 240 kJ/m 3 (15 and 30 MGOe)] 
are considerably higher than the conventional hard magnetic materials (Table 20.6); 
in addition, they have relatively large coercivities. Powder metallurgical techniques 
are used to fabricate SmCo 5 magnets. The appropriately alloyed material is first 
ground into a fine powder; the powder particles are aligned using an external mag¬ 
netic field and then pressed into the desired shape. The piece is then sintered at an 
elevated temperature, followed by another heat treatment that improves the mag¬ 
netic properties. 

Neodymium-Iron-Boron Magnets 

Samarium is a rare and relatively expensive material; furthermore, the price of cobalt 
is variable and its sources are unreliable. Consequently, the Nd 2 Fe 14 B alloys have 
become the materials of choice for a large number and wide diversity of applications 





20.11 Magnetic Storage * 825 


requiring hard magnetic materials. Coercivities and energy products of these mate¬ 
rials rival those of the samarium-cobalt alloys (Table 20.6). 

The magnetization-demagnetization behavior of these materials is a function of 
domain wall mobility, which, in turn, is controlled by the final microstructure—that is, 
the size, shape, and orientation of the crystallites or grains, as well as the nature and 
distribution of any second-phase particles that are present. Of course, microstructure 
will depend on how the material is processed. Two different processing techniques are 
available for the fabrication of Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnets: powder metallurgy (sintering) and 
rapid solidification (melt spinning). The powder metallurgical approach is similar to 
that used for the SmCo 5 materials. For rapid solidification, the alloy, in molten form, 
is quenched very rapidly such that either an amorphous or very fine-grained and thin 
solid ribbon is produced. This ribbon material is then pulverized, compacted into the 
desired shape, and subsequently heat-treated. Rapid solidification is the more involved 
of the two fabrication processes; nevertheless, it is continuous, whereas powder met¬ 
allurgy is a batch process, which has its inherent disadvantages. 

These high-energy hard magnetic materials are employed in a host of different 
devices in a variety of technological fields. One common application is in motors. 
Permanent magnets are far superior to electromagnets in that their magnetic fields 
are continuously maintained and without the necessity of expending electrical 
power; furthermore, no heat is generated during operation. Motors using perma¬ 
nent magnets are much smaller than their electromagnet counterparts and are used 
extensively in fractional horsepower units. Familiar motor applications include the 
following: in cordless drills and screwdrivers; in automobiles (starting, window 
winder, wiper, washer, and fan motors); in audio and video recorders; and in clocks. 
Other common devices that employ these magnetic materials are speakers in au¬ 
dio systems, lightweight earphones, hearing aids, and computer peripherals. 


20.11 MAGNETIC STORAGE 

Magnetic materials are important in the area of information storage; in fact, magnetic 
recording 5 has become virtually the universal technology for the storage of electronic 
information. This is evidenced by the preponderance of disk storage media [e.g., com¬ 
puters (both desktop and laptop), iPods and MP3 players, and high-definition 
camcorder hard drives], credit/debit cards (mag stripes), and so on. Whereas in com¬ 
puters, semiconductor elements serve as primary memory, magnetic hard disks are 
normally used for secondary memory because they are capable of storing larger quan¬ 
tities of information and at a lower cost; however, their transfer rates are slower. 
Furthermore, the recording and television industries rely heavily on magnetic tapes 
for the storage and reproduction of audio and video sequences. In addition, tapes are 
used with large computer systems to back up and archive data. 

In essence, computer bytes, sound, or visual images in the form of electrical sig¬ 
nals are recorded magnetically on very small segments of the magnetic storage 
medium—a tape or disk. Transference to (i.e., “writing”) and retrieval from (i.e., 
“reading”) the tape or disk is accomplished by means of a recording system that 
consists of read and write heads. For hard drives, this head system is supported 


5 The term magnetic recording is often used to denote the recording and storage of audio 
and video and audio signals, whereas in the field of computing magnetic storage is frequently 
preferred.

above and in close proximity to the magnetic medium by a self-generating air bear¬ 
ing as the medium passes beneath at relatively high rotational speeds. 6 On the other 
hand, tapes make physical contact with the heads during read and write operations. 
Tape velocities run as high as 10 m/s. 

As noted previously, there are two principal types of magnetic media— hard 
disk drives (HDDs) and magnetic tapes— both of which we now briefly discuss. 

Hard Disk Drives 

Hard disk magnetic storage hard drives consist of rigid circular disks [having diam¬ 
eters that range between about 65 mm (2.5 in.) and 95 mm (3.75 in)]. During read 
and write processes, disks rotate at relatively high velocities—5400 and 7200 revo¬ 
lutions per minute are common. Rapid rates of data storage and retrieval are pos¬ 
sible using HDDs, as are also high storage densities. 

For the current HDD technology, “magnetic bits” point up or down perpendi¬ 
cular to the plane of the disk surface; this scheme is appropriately called perpendi¬ 
cular magnetic recording (abbreviated PMR ), and is represented schematically in 
Figure 20.23. 

Data (or bits) are introduced (written) into the storage medium using an induc¬ 
tive write head. For one head design, shown in Figure 20.23, a time-varying write mag¬ 
netic flux is generated at the tip of the main pole—a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic core 
material around which a wire coil is wound—by an electric current (also time- 
variable) that passes through the coil. This flux penetrates through the magnetic stor¬ 
age layer into a magnetically soft underlayer and then reenters the head assembly 
through a return pole (Figure 20.23). A very intense magnetic field is concentrated 
in the storage layer beneath the tip of the main pole. At this point, data are written 
as a very small region of the storage layer becomes magnetized. Upon removal of the 
field (i.e., as the disk continues its rotation), the magnetization remains; that is, the 
signal (i.e., data) has been stored. Digital data storage (i.e., as ones and zeros) is in 
the form of minute magnetization patterns; the ones and zeros correspond to the pres¬ 
ence or absence of magnetic reversal directions between adjacent regions. 


6 It is sometimes stated that the head “flies” over the disk.

microstructure of the perpendicular 
magnetic recording medium used in

medium” consists of small grains of a 
cobalt-chromium alloy (darker 
regions) that are isolated from one 
another by an oxide grain-boundary 
segregant (lighter regions). 
(Photograph courtesy of Seagate 
Recording Media.) 


Data retrieval from the storage medium is accomplished using a magnetoresistive- 
read head (Figure 20.23). During read-back, magnetic fields from the written magnetic 
patterns are sensed by this head; these fields produce changes in electrical resistance. 
The resulting signals are then processed so as to reproduce the original data. 

The storage layer is composed of granular media—& thin film (15-20 nm thick) 
consisting of very small (~10-nm diameter) and isolated grains of a HCP 
cobalt-chromium alloy that are magnetically anisotropic. Other alloying elements 
(notably Pt and Ta) are added to enhance the magnetic anisotropy as well as to 
form oxide grain-boundary segregants that isolate the grains. Figure 20.24 is a trans¬ 
mission electron micrograph that shows the grain structure of an HDD storage layer. 
Each grain is a single domain that is oriented with its c-axis (i.e., [0001] crystallo¬ 
graphic direction) perpendicular (or nearly perpendicular) to the disk surface. This 
[0001] direction is the direction of easy magnetization for Co (Figure 20.18); thus, 
when magnetized, the direction of magnetization of each grain has this desired per¬ 
pendicular orientation. Reliable storage of data requires that each bit written on 
the disk encompasses approximately 100 grains. Furthermore, there is a lower limit 
to the grain size; for grain sizes below this limit, there is the possibility that the 
direction of magnetization will spontaneously reverse because of the effects of ther¬ 
mal agitation (Section 20.6), which causes a loss of stored data. 

The current storage capacities of perpendicular HDDs are in excess of 100 Gbit/in. 2 
(10 11 bit/in. 2 ); the ultimate goal for HDDs is a storage capacity of 1 Tbit/in 2 (10 12 bit/in. 2 ). 

Magnetic Tapes 

The development of magnetic tape storage preceded that for the hard disk drives. 
Today, tape storage is less expensive than HDD; however, areal storage densities are 
lower for tape (by a factor of on the order of 100). Tapes [of standard 0.5-in. (12.7- 
mm) width] are wound onto reels and enclosed within cartridges, for protection and 
to facilitate handling. During operation, a tape drive, using precision-synchronized 
motors, winds the tape from one reel onto another past a read/write head system 
in order to access a point of interest. Typical tape speeds are 4.8 m/s; some systems, 
however, run as high as 10 m/s. Head systems for tape storage are similar to those 
employed for HDDs, as described previously.

For the latest tape-memory technology, storage media are particulates of 
magnetic materials that have dimensions on the order of tens of nanometers: 
ferromagnetic metal particles that are acicular (needle-shaped), and hexagonal and 
tabular (plate-shaped) ferrimagnetic barium-ferrite particles. Photomicrographs of 
both media types are shown in Figure 20.25. Tape products use one particle type 
or the other (not both together), depending on application. These magnetic parti¬ 
cles are thoroughly and uniformly dispersed in a proprietary high-molecular-weight 
organic binder material to form a magnetic layer that is approximately 50 nm thick. 
Beneath this layer is nonmagnetic thin-film support substrate (of thickness be¬ 
tween about 100 and 300 nm), which is attached to the tape. Either poly(ethylene 
naphthalate) (PEN) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the material used 
for the tape. 

Both particle types are magnetically anisotropic—that is, they have an “easy” 
or preferential direction along which they may be magnetized; for example, for 
the metal particles this direction is parallel to their long axes. During manufac¬ 
ture, these particles are aligned such that this direction parallels the direction of 
motion of the tape past the write head. Inasmuch as each particle is a single do¬ 
main that may be magnetized only in one direction or its opposite by the write 
head, two magnetic states are possible. These two states allow for the storage of 
information in digital form, as ones and zeros. 

Using the plate-shaped barium-ferrite medium, a tape-storage density of 6.7 
Gbit/in. 2 has been achieved. For the industry-standard LTO tape cartridge, this den¬ 
sity corresponds to a storage capacity of 8 Tbytes of uncompressed data. 

20.12 SUPERCONDUCTIVITY 

Superconductivity is basically an electrical phenomenon; however, its discussion has 
been deferred to this point because there are magnetic implications relative to the 
superconducting state, and, in addition, superconducting materials are used prima¬ 
rily in magnets capable of generating high fields. 

As most high-purity metals are cooled down to temperatures nearing 0 K, the 
electrical resistivity decreases gradually, approaching some small yet finite value 
that is characteristic of the particular metal. There are a few materials, however, for 
which the resistivity, at a very low temperature, abruptly plunges from a finite value

to one that is virtually zero and remains there upon further cooling. Materials that 
display this latter behavior are called superconductors, and the temperature at which 
they attain superconductivity is called the critical temperature T c . 7 The 
resistivity-temperature behaviors for superconductive and nonsuperconductive ma¬ 
terials are contrasted in Figure 20.26. The critical temperature varies from super¬ 
conductor to superconductor but lies between less than 1 K and approximately 20 
K for metals and metal alloys. Recently, it has been demonstrated that some com¬ 
plex oxide ceramics have critical temperatures in excess of 100 K. 

At temperatures below T c , the superconducting state will cease upon applica¬ 
tion of a sufficiently large magnetic field, termed the critical field H c ,, which de¬ 
pends on temperature and decreases with increasing temperature. The same may 
be said for current density; that is, a critical applied current density J c exists below 
which a material is superconductive. Figure 20.27 shows schematically the bound¬ 
ary in temperature-magnetic field-current density space separating normal and su¬ 
perconducting states. The position of this boundary will, of course, depend on the 
material. For temperature, magnetic field, and current density values lying between

superconducting critical temperature in the scientific literature. They are totally different 
entities and should not be confused. In this discussion they are denoted by T c and T c , 
respectively.

the origin and this boundary, the material will be superconductive; outside the 
boundary, conduction is normal. 

The superconductivity phenomenon has been satisfactorily explained by means of 
a rather involved theory. In essence, the superconductive state results from attractive 
interactions between pairs of conducting electrons; the motions of these paired elec¬ 
trons become coordinated such that scattering by thermal vibrations and impurity 
atoms is highly inefficient. Thus, the resistivity, being proportional to the incidence of 
electron scattering, is zero. 

On the basis of magnetic response, superconducting materials may be divided into 
two classifications designated as type I and type II. Type I materials, while in the su¬ 
perconducting state, are completely diamagnetic; that is, all of an applied magnetic field 
will be excluded from the body of material, a phenomenon known as the Meissner 
effect , which is illustrated in Figure 20.28. As H is increased, the material remains dia¬ 
magnetic until the critical magnetic field H c is reached. At this point, conduction 
becomes normal, and complete magnetic flux penetration takes place. Several metal¬ 
lic elements including aluminum, lead, tin, and mercury belong to the type I group. 

Type II superconductors are completely diamagnetic at low applied fields, and 
field exclusion is total. However, the transition from the superconducting state to 
the normal state is gradual and occurs between lower critical and upper critical 
fields, designated H C1 and H C1 , respectively. The magnetic flux lines begin to pene¬ 
trate into the body of material at H C1 , and with increasing applied magnetic field, 
this penetration continues; at H C2 , field penetration is complete. For fields between 
H C1 and H C1 , the material exists in what is termed a mixed state —both normal and 
superconducting regions are present. 

Type II superconductors are preferred over type I for most practical applica¬ 
tions by virtue of their higher critical temperatures and critical magnetic fields. At 
present, the three most commonly used superconductors are niobium-zirconium 
(Nb-Zr) and niobium-titanium (Nb-Ti) alloys and the niobium-tin intermetallic 
compound Nb 3 Sn. Table 20.7 lists several type I and II superconductors, their crit¬ 
ical temperatures, and their critical magnetic flux densities. 

Recently, a family of ceramic materials that are normally electrically insulative 
have been found to be superconductors with inordinately high critical temperatures. 
Initial research has centered on yttrium barium copper oxide, YBa 2 Cu 3 0 7 , which 
has a critical temperature of about 92 K. This material has a complex perovskite- 
type crystal structure (Section 12.2). New superconducting ceramic materials re¬ 
ported to have even higher critical temperatures have been and are currently be¬ 
ing developed. Several of these materials and their critical temperatures are listed 
in Table 20.7. The technological potential of these materials is extremely promising 
inasmuch as their critical temperatures are above 77 K, which permits the use of

liquid nitrogen, a very inexpensive coolant in comparison to liquid hydrogen and 
liquid helium. These new ceramic superconductors are not without drawbacks, chief 
of which is their brittle nature. This characteristic limits the ability of these materi¬ 
als to be fabricated into useful forms such as wires. 

The phenomenon of superconductivity has many important practical implica¬ 
tions. Superconducting magnets capable of generating high fields with low power 
consumption are currently being employed in scientific test and research equip¬ 
ment. In addition, they are also used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 
medical field as a diagnostic tool. Abnormalities in body tissues and organs can be 
detected on the basis of the production of cross-sectional images. Chemical analy¬ 
sis of body tissues is also possible using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 
Numerous other potential applications of superconducting materials also exist. 
Some of the areas being explored include (1) electrical power transmission through 
superconducting materials—power losses would be extremely low, and the equip¬ 
ment would operate at low voltage levels; (2) magnets for high-energy particle ac¬ 
celerators; (3) higher-speed switching and signal transmission for computers; and 
(4) high-speed magnetically levitated trains, wherein the levitation results from mag¬ 
netic field repulsion. The chief deterrent to the widespread application of these 
superconducting materials is, of course, the difficulty in attaining and maintaining 
extremely low temperatures. Hopefully, this problem will be overcome with the de¬ 
velopment of the new generation of superconductors with reasonably high critical 
temperatures. 





832 * Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties 

SUMMARY 


Basic Concepts 

• The macroscopic magnetic properties of a material are a consequence of inter¬ 
actions between an external magnetic field and the magnetic dipole moments of 
the constituent atoms. 

• The magnetic field strength ( H ) within a coil of wire is proportional to the num¬ 
ber of wire turns and the magnitude of the current, and inversely proportional 
to the coil length (Equation 20.1). 

• Magnetic flux density and magnetic field strength are proportional to one 
another. 

In a vacuum, the constant of proportionality is the permeability of a vacuum 
(Equation 20.3). 

When some material is present, this constant is the permeability of the material 
(Equation 20.2). 

• Associated with each individual electron are both orbital and spin magnetic 
moments. 

The magnitude of an electron’s orbital magnetic moment is equal to the prod¬ 
uct of the value of the Bohr magneton and the electron’s magnetic quantum 
number. 

An electron’s spin magnetic moment is plus or minus the value of the Bohr 
magneton (plus for spin up, and minus for spin down). 

• The net magnetic moment for an atom is just the sum of the contributions of 
each of its electrons, wherein there will be spin and orbital moment cancellation 
of electron pairs. When cancellation is complete, the atom will possess no mag¬ 
netic moment. 

Diamagnetism and Paramagnetism 

• Diamagnetism results from changes in electron orbital motion that are induced by 
an external field. The effect is extremely small (with susceptibilities on the order 
of -1CT 5 ) and in opposition to the applied field. All materials are diamagnetic. 

• Paramagnetic materials are those having permanent atomic dipoles, which are 
acted on individually and aligned in the direction of an external field. 

• Diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials are considered nonmagnetic because 
the magnetizations are relatively small and persist only while an applied field is 
present. 

Ferromagnetism 

• Large and permanent magnetizations may be established within the ferromag¬ 
netic metals (Fe, Co, Ni). 

• Atomic magnetic dipole moments are of spin origin, which are coupled and mu¬ 
tually aligned with moments of adjacent atoms. 

Antiferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism 

• Antiparallel coupling of adjacent cation spin moments is found for some ionic 
materials. Those in which there is total cancellation of spin moments are termed 
antiferromagnetic. 

• With ferrimagnetism, permanent magnetization is possible because spin moment 
cancellation is incomplete. 



Summary * 833 


• For cubic ferrites, the net magnetization results from the divalent ions (e.g., Fe 2+ ) 
that reside on octahedral lattice sites, the spin moments of which are all mutu¬ 
ally aligned. 

The Influence of Temperature on Magnetic Behavior 

• With rising temperature, increased thermal vibrations tend to counteract the di¬ 
pole coupling forces in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. Consequently, 
the saturation magnetization gradually diminishes with temperature, up to the 
Curie temperature, at which point it drops to near zero (Figure 20.10). 

• Above T c , ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials are paramagnetic. 

Domains and Hysteresis 

• Below its Curie temperature, a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material is 
composed of domains—small-volume regions wherein all net dipole moments are 
mutually aligned and the magnetization is saturated (Figure 20.11). 

• The total magnetization of the solid is just the appropriately weighted vector sum 
of the magnetizations of all these domains. 

• As an external magnetic field is applied, domains having magnetization vectors 
oriented in the direction of the field grow at the expense of domains that have 
unfavorable magnetization orientations (Figure 20.13). 

• At total saturation, the entire solid is a single domain and the magnetization is 
aligned with the field direction. 

• The change in domain structure with increase or reversal of a magnetic field is 
accomplished by the motion of domain walls. Both hysteresis (the lag of the B 
field behind the applied H field) as well as permanent magnetization (or rema- 
nence) result from the resistance to movement of these domain walls. 

• From a complete hysteresis curve for a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic material the 
following may be determined: 

Remanence—value of the B field when H = 0 (B n Figure 20.14) 

Coercivity—value of the H field when B = 0 ( H c , Figure 20.14) 

Magnetic Anisotropy 

• The M (or B) versus H behavior for a ferromagnetic single crystal is anisotropic— 
that is, dependent on the crystallographic direction along which the magnetic field 
is applied. 

• The crystallographic direction for which M s is achieved at the lowest H field is 
an easy magnetization direction. 

• For Fe, Ni, and Co easy magnetization directions are, respectively, [100], [111], 
and [0001]. 

• Energy losses in transformer cores made of magnetic ferrous alloys may be min¬ 
imized by taking advantage of anisotropic magnetic behavior. 

Soft Magnetic Materials 

Hard Magnetic Materials 

• For soft magnetic materials, domain wall movement is easy during magnetization 
and demagnetization. Consequently, they have small hysteresis loops and low en¬ 
ergy losses. 

• Domain wall motion is much more difficult for the hard magnetic materials, which 
results in larger hysteresis loops; because greater fields are required to demag¬ 
netize these materials, the magnetization is more permanent. 


834 * Chapter 20 / Magnetic Properties 

Magnetic Storage 

• Information storage is accomplished using magnetic materials; the two principal 
types of magnetic media are hard disk drives and magnetic tapes. 

• The storage medium for hard disk drives is composed of nanometer-size grains 
of an HCP cobalt-chromium ahoy. These grains are oriented such that their di¬ 
rection of easy magnetization (i.e., [0001]) is perpendicular to the plane of the 
disk. 

• For tape-memory storage, either needle-shaped ferromagnetic metal particles 
or plate-shaped ferromagnetic barium-ferrite particles are employed. Particle size 
is on the order of tens of nanometers. 

Superconductivity 

• Superconductivity has been observed in a number of materials; upon cooling and 
in the vicinity of absolute zero temperature, the electrical resistivity vanishes (Fig¬ 
ure 20.26). 

• The superconducting state ceases to exist if temperature, magnetic field, or cur¬ 
rent density exceeds a critical value. 

• For type I superconductors, magnetic field exclusion is complete below a critical 
field, and field penetration is complete once H c is exceeded. This penetration is 
gradual with increasing magnetic field for type II materials. 

• New complex oxide ceramics are being developed with relatively high criti¬ 
cal temperatures, which allow inexpensive liquid nitrogen to be used as a 
coolant.

the discussion of this chapter, x m was used 
to designate the volume susceptibility in SI 
units, that is, the quantity that gives the 
magnetization per unit volume (m 3 ) of 
material when multiplied by H. The mass 
susceptibility x m (kg) yields the magnetic 
moment (or magnetization) per kilogram 
of material when multiplied by H\ similarly, 
the atomic susceptibility ^m( a ) gives the 
magnetization per kilogram-mole. The 
latter two quantities are related to x m through 
the relationships

WHY STUDY the Optical Properties of Materials? 


When materials are exposed to electromagnetic radia¬ 
tion, it is sometimes important to be able to predict 
and alter their responses. This is possible when we are 
familiar with their optical properties and understand 
the mechanisms responsible for their optical behaviors. 
For example, in Section 21.14 on optical fiber materials. 


we note that the performance of optical fibers is 
increased by introducing a gradual variation of the 
index of refraction (i.e., a graded index) at the outer 
surface of the fiber. This is accomplished by the 
addition of specific impurities in controlled 
concentrations.

21.1 INTRODUCTION 

Optical property refers to a material’s response to exposure to electromagnetic ra¬ 
diation and, in particular, to visible light. This chapter first discusses some of the 
basic principles and concepts relating to the nature of electromagnetic radiation 
and its possible interactions with solid materials. Next to be explored are the optical 
behaviors of metallic and nonmetallic materials in terms of their absorption, re¬ 
flection, and transmission characteristics. The final sections outline luminescence, 
photoconductivity, and light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation 
(laser), the practical use of these phenomena, and optical fibers in communications. 

Basic Concepts 

21.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION 

In the classical sense, electromagnetic radiation is considered to be wavelike, con¬ 
sisting of electric and magnetic field components that are perpendicular to each 
other and also to the direction of propagation (Figure 21.1). Light, heat (or radiant 
energy), radar, radio waves, and x-rays are ah forms of electromagnetic radiation. 
Each is characterized primarily by a specific range of wavelengths, and also ac¬ 
cording to the technique by which it is generated. The electromagnetic spectrum of 
radiation spans the wide range from y-rays (emitted by radioactive materials) hav¬ 
ing wavelengths on the order of 10“ 12 m (1CT 3 nm), through x-rays, ultraviolet, visible, 
infrared, and finally radio waves with wavelengths as long as 10 5 m. This spectrum, 
on a logarithmic scale, is shown in Figure 21.2. 

Visible light lies within a very narrow region of the spectrum, with wavelengths 
ranging between about 0.4 pm (4 X 10 -7 m) and 0.7 pm. The perceived color is

determined by wavelength; for example, radiation having a wavelength of approx¬ 
imately 0.4 |xm appears violet, whereas green and red occur at about 0.5 and 0.65 
p,m, respectively. The spectral ranges for the several colors are included in Figure 
21.2. White light is simply a mixture of all colors. The ensuing discussion is con¬ 
cerned primarily with this visible radiation, by definition the only radiation to which 
the eye is sensitive. 

All electromagnetic radiation traverses a vacuum at the same velocity, that of 
light—namely, 3 X 10 8 m/s (186,000 miles/s). This velocity, c, is related to the electric 
permittivity of a vacuum 6 0 and the magnetic permeability of a vacuum jm 0 through 


Ve 0 /x 0 

Thus, there is an association between the electromagnetic constant c and these elec¬ 
trical and magnetic constants.

Furthermore, the frequency v and the wavelength A of the electromagnetic ra¬ 
diation are a function of velocity according to 

c = Av (21.2) 

Frequency is expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), and 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second. 
Ranges of frequency for the various forms of electromagnetic radiation are also in¬ 
cluded in the spectrum (Figure 21.2). 

Sometimes it is more convenient to view electromagnetic radiation from a 
quantum-mechanical perspective, in which the radiation, rather than consisting of 
waves, is composed of groups or packets of energy, which are called photons. The 
energy E of a photon is said to be quantized, or can only have specific values, defined 
by the relationship 


E = hv = — (21.3) 

A 

where h is a universal constant called Planck’s constant, which has a value of 
6.63 X 10 -34 J • s. Thus, photon energy is proportional to the frequency of the radi¬ 
ation, or inversely proportional to the wavelength. Photon energies are also included 
in the electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 21.2). 

When describing optical phenomena involving the interactions between radia¬ 
tion and matter, an explanation is often facilitated if light is treated in terms of 
photons. On other occasions, a wave treatment is more appropriate; at one time or 
another, both approaches are used in this discussion.

21.3 LIGHT INTERACTIONS WITH SOLIDS 


Intensity of incident 
beam at an interface 
is equal to the sum 
of the intensities of 
transmitted, 
absorbed, and 
reflected beams 


When light proceeds from one medium into another (e.g., from air into a solid sub¬ 
stance), several things happen. Some of the light radiation may be transmitted 
through the medium, some will be absorbed, and some will be reflected at the in¬ 
terface between the two media. The intensity 7 0 of the beam incident to the surface 
of the solid medium must equal the sum of the intensities of the transmitted, ab¬ 
sorbed, and reflected beams, denoted as I T , I A , and I R , respectively, or 

I 0 = I t + I a + I r (21.4)

transparent 

translucent 


opaque 


Radiation intensity, expressed in watts per square meter, corresponds to the energy 
being transmitted per unit of time across a unit area that is perpendicular to the di¬ 
rection of propagation. 

An alternate form of Equation 21.4 is 

T + A + R = 1 (21.5) 

where T, A , and R represent, respectively, the transmissivity (IjJIo), absorptivity 
(/ A // 0 ), and reflectivity (7y/ 0 ), or the fractions of incident light that are transmitted, 
absorbed, and reflected by a material; their sum must equal unity, because all the 
incident light is either transmitted, absorbed, or reflected. 

Materials that are capable of transmitting light with relatively little absorption 
and reflection are transparent— one can see through them. Translucent materials 
are those through which light is transmitted diffusely; that is, light is scattered within 
the interior, to the degree that objects are not clearly distinguishable when viewed 
through a specimen of the material. Materials that are impervious to the transmis¬ 
sion of visible light are termed opaque. 

Bulk metals are opaque throughout the entire visible spectrum; that is, all light 
radiation is either absorbed or reflected. On the other hand, electrically insulating 
materials can be made to be transparent. Furthermore, some semiconducting ma¬ 
terials are transparent whereas others are opaque. 


21.4 ATOMIC AND ELECTRONIC INTERACTIONS 

The optical phenomena that occur within solid materials involve interactions between 
the electromagnetic radiation and atoms, ions, and/or electrons. Two of the most im¬ 
portant of these interactions are electronic polarization and electron energy transitions. 

Electronic Polarization 

One component of an electromagnetic wave is simply a rapidly fluctuating electric 
field (Figure 21.1). For the visible range of frequencies, this electric field interacts 
with the electron cloud surrounding each atom within its path in such a way as to 
induce electronic polarization, or to shift the electron cloud relative to the nucleus 
of the atom with each change in direction of electric field component, as demon¬ 
strated in Figure 18.32 a. Two consequences of this polarization are as follows: (1) 
some of the radiation energy may be absorbed, and (2) light waves are retarded in 
velocity as they pass through the medium. The second consequence is manifested 
as refraction, a phenomenon to be discussed in Section 21.5. 


For an electron 
transition, change in 
energy equals the 
product of Planck’s 
constant and the 
frequency of 
radiation absorbed 
(or emitted) 


Electron Transitions 

The absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation may involve electron tran¬ 
sitions from one energy state to another. For the sake of this discussion, consider an 
isolated atom, the electron energy diagram for which is represented in Figure 21.3. An 
electron may be excited from an occupied state at energy E 2 to a vacant and higher- 
lying one, denoted E 4 , by the absorption of a photon of energy. The change in energy 
experienced by the electron, A E, depends on the radiation frequency as follows: 

A E = hv (21.6) 

where, again, h is Planck’s constant. At this point it is important that several concepts 
be understood. First, because the energy states for the atom are discrete, only specific 
AEs exist between the energy levels; thus, only photons of frequencies corresponding 
to the possible AEs for the atom can be absorbed by electron transitions. Furthermore, 
all of a photon’s energy is absorbed in each excitation event.

Figure 21.3 For an isolated atom, a schematic 
illustration of photon absorption by the 
excitation of an electron from one energy 
state to another. The energy of the photon 
(hv 42 ) must be exactly equal to the difference 
in energy between the two states (E 4 - E 2 ). 


A second important concept is that a stimulated electron cannot remain in an 
excited state indefinitely; after a short time, it falls or decays back into its ground 
state, or unexcited level, with a reemission of electromagnetic radiation. Several de¬ 
cay paths are possible, and these are discussed later. In any case, there must be a 
conservation of energy for absorption and emission electron transitions. 

As the ensuing discussions show, the optical characteristics of solid materials 
that relate to absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation are explained 
in terms of the electron band structure of the material (possible band structures 
were discussed in Section 18.5) and the principles relating to electron transitions, 
as outlined in the preceding two paragraphs. 

Properties of Metals 

Consider the electron energy band schemes for metals as illustrated in Figures 18.4a 
and 18.4Z?; in both cases a high-energy band is only partially filled with electrons. 
Metals are opaque because the incident radiation having frequencies within the vis¬ 
ible range excites electrons into unoccupied energy states above the Fermi energy, 
as demonstrated in Figure 21.4a; as a consequence, the incident radiation is ab¬ 
sorbed, in accordance with Equation 21.6. Total absorption is within a very thin

outer layer, usually less than 0.1 jxm; thus only metallic films thinner than 0.1 |xm 
are capable of transmitting visible light. 

All frequencies of visible light are absorbed by metals because of the continu¬ 
ously available empty electron states, which permit electron transitions as in Figure 
21.4^. In fact, metals are opaque to all electromagnetic radiation on the low end of 
the frequency spectrum, from radio waves, through infrared and the visible, and into 
about the middle of the ultraviolet radiation. Metals are transparent to high- 
frequency (x- and y-ray) radiation. 

Most of the absorbed radiation is reemitted from the surface in the form of vis¬ 
ible light of the same wavelength, which appears as reflected light; an electron tran¬ 
sition accompanying reradiation is shown in Figure 21 Ab. The reflectivity for most 
metals is between 0.90 and 0.95; some small fraction of the energy from electron 
decay processes is dissipated as heat. 

Because metals are opaque and highly reflective, the perceived color is de¬ 
termined by the wavelength distribution of the radiation that is reflected and not 
absorbed. A bright silvery appearance when exposed to white light indicates that 
the metal is highly reflective over the entire range of the visible spectrum. In 
other words, for the reflected beam, the composition of these reemitted photons, 
in terms of frequency and number, is approximately the same as for the incident 
beam. Aluminum and silver are two metals that exhibit this reflective behavior. 
Copper and gold appear red-orange and yellow, respectively, because some of 
the energy associated with light photons having short wavelengths is not reemit¬ 
ted as visible light.

[The answer may be found at www.wiley.com/college/callister (Student Companion Site).] 


Optical Properties of Nonmetals 


By virtue of their electron energy band structures, nonmetallic materials may be 
transparent to visible light. Therefore, in addition to reflection and absorption, re¬ 
fraction and transmission phenomena also need to be considered. 


21.5 REFRACTION 

Light that is transmitted into the interior of transparent materials experiences a de¬ 
crease in velocity, and, as a result, is bent at the interface; this phenomenon is termed 
refraction, index of refraction. The index of refraction n of a material is defined as the ratio of the ve- 
refraction locity in a vacuum c to the velocity in the medium v , or 


Definition of index 
of refraction—the 
ratio of light 
velocities in a 
vacuum and in the 
medium of interest 



(21.7) 


The magnitude of n (or the degree of bending) will depend on the wavelength of 
the light. This effect is graphically demonstrated by the familiar dispersion or sep¬ 
aration of a beam of white light into its component colors by a glass prism. Each

color is deflected by a different amount as it passes into and out of the glass, which 
results in the separation of the colors. Not only does the index of refraction affect 
the optical path of light, but also, as explained shortly, it influences the fraction of 
incident light that is reflected at the surface. 

Just as Equation 21.1 defines the magnitude of c, an equivalent expression gives 
the velocity of light v in a medium as 


v = 



( 21 . 8 ) 


where e and /jl are, respectively, the permittivity and permeability of the particular 
substance. From Equation 21.7, we have 



Ve/Z 


V e r fji r 


(21.9) 


where e r and pt r are the dielectric constant and the relative magnetic permeability, 
respectively. Because most substances are only slightly magnetic, pt r = 1, and 

n =\fe r (21.10) 


Thus, for transparent materials, there is a relation between the index of refraction 
and the dielectric constant. As already mentioned, the phenomenon of refraction is 
related to electronic polarization (Section 21.4) at the relatively high frequencies 
for visible light; thus, the electronic component of the dielectric constant may be 
determined from index of refraction measurements using Equation 21.10. 

Because the retardation of electromagnetic radiation in a medium results from 
electronic polarization, the size of the constituent atoms or ions has a considerable 
influence on the magnitude of this effect—generally, the larger an atom or ion, the 
greater the electronic polarization, the slower the velocity, and the greater the index 
of refraction. The index of refraction for a typical soda-lime glass is approximately 
1.5. Additions of large barium and lead ions (as BaO and PbO) to a glass will in¬ 
crease n significantly. For example, highly leaded glasses containing 90 wt% PbO 
have an index of refraction of approximately 2.1. 

For crystalline ceramics that have cubic crystal structures, and for glasses, the 
index of refraction is independent of crystallographic direction (i.e., it is 
isotropic). Noncubic crystals, on the other hand, have an anisotropic n\ that is, 
the index is greatest along the directions that have the highest density of ions. 
Table 21.1 gives refractive indices for several glasses, transparent ceramics, and 
polymers. Average values are provided for the crystalline ceramics in which n is 
anisotropic.

reflectivity—in

Reflectivity (for 
normal incidence) at 
interface between 
two media having 
indices of refraction 
of n x and n 2 


When light radiation passes from one medium into another having a different index 
of refraction, some of the light is scattered at the interface between the two media 
even if both are transparent. The reflectivity R represents the fraction of the incident 
light that is reflected at the interface, or 



( 21 . 11 ) 


where 7 0 and I R are the intensities of the incident and reflected beams, respectively. 
If the light is normal (or perpendicular) to the interface, then

( 21 . 12 ) 


where n x and n 2 are the indices of refraction of the two media. If the incident light 
is not normal to the interface, R will depend on the angle of incidence. When light 
is transmitted from a vacuum or air into a solid s, then 


R = 


- iv 


n„ + 1 


(21.13) 


because the index of refraction of air is very nearly unity. Thus, the higher the in¬ 
dex of refraction of the solid, the greater the reflectivity. For typical silicate glasses, 
the reflectivity is approximately 0.05. Just as the index of refraction of a solid de¬ 
pends on the wavelength of the incident light, so also does the reflectivity vary with 
wavelength. Reflection losses for lenses and other optical instruments are mini¬ 
mized significantly by coating the reflecting surface with very thin layers of dielec¬ 
tric materials such as magnesium fluoride (MgF 2 ). 







21.7 Absorption * 849 


21.7 ABSORPTION 


For a nonmetallic 
material, condition 
for absorption of a 
photon (of radiation) 
by an electron 
transition in terms of 
radiation frequency 


Nonmetallic materials may be opaque or transparent to visible light; if transparent, 
they often appear colored. In principle, light radiation is absorbed in this group of 
materials by two basic mechanisms, which also influence the transmission charac¬ 
teristics of these nonmetals. One of these is electronic polarization (Section 21.4). 
Absorption by electronic polarization is important only at light frequencies in the 
vicinity of the relaxation frequency of the constituent atoms. The other mechanism 
involves valence band-conduction band electron transitions, which depend on the 
electron energy band structure of the material; band structures for semiconductors 
and insulators were discussed in Section 18.5. 

Absorption of a photon of light may occur by the promotion or excitation of 
an electron from the nearly filled valence band, across the band gap, and into an 
empty state within the conduction band, as demonstrated in Figure 21.5a; a free 
electron in the conduction band and a hole in the valence band are created. Again, 
the energy of excitation A E is related to the absorbed photon frequency through 
Equation 21.6. These excitations with the accompanying absorption can take place 
only if the photon energy is greater than that of the band gap E g — that is, if 

hv > E g (21.14)

Or, no visible light is absorbed by nonmetallic materials having band gap energies 
greater than about 3.1 eV; these materials, if of high purity, will appear transparent 
and colorless.

band gap energy for 
absorption of visible 
light by valence-

On the other hand, the maximum wavelength for visible light, A(max), is about 
0.7 p,m; computation of the minimum band gap energy E g (min) for which there is 
absorption of visible light is according to 

( • \ he

= -- -i -- = 1.8 eV (21.16b) 

7 X 10 -7 m 


This result means that ah visible light is absorbed by valence-band-to-conduction- 
band electron transitions for semiconducting materials that have band gap energies 
less than about 1.8 eV; thus, these materials are opaque. Only a portion of the vis¬ 
ible spectrum is absorbed by materials having band gap energies between 1.8 and 
3.1 eV; consequently, these materials appear colored. 

Every nonmetallic material becomes opaque at some wavelength, which de¬ 
pends on the magnitude of its E g . For example, diamond, having a band gap of 5.6 
eV, is opaque to radiation having wavelengths less than about 0.22 |xm. 

Interactions with light radiation can also occur in dielectric solids having wide 
band gaps, involving other than valence band-conduction band electron transitions. 
If impurities or other electrically active defects are present, electron levels within 
the band gap may be introduced, such as the donor and acceptor levels (Section 
18.11), except that they he closer to the center of the band gap. Light radiation of 
specific wavelengths may be emitted as a result of electron transitions involving 
these levels within the band gap. For example, consider Figure 21.6a, which shows 
the valence band-conduction band electron excitation for a material that has one 
such impurity level. Again, the electromagnetic energy that was absorbed by this

electron excitation must be dissipated in some manner; several mechanisms are 
possible. For one, this dissipation may occur via direct electron and hole recombi¬ 
nation according to the reaction 

electron + hole -> energy (AE) (21.17) 

which is represented schematically in Figure 21.56. In addition, multiple-step elec¬ 
tron transitions may occur, which involve impurity levels lying within the band gap. 
One possibility, as indicated in Figure 21.66, is the emission of two photons; one is 
emitted as the electron drops from a state in the conduction band to the impurity 
level, the other as it decays back into the valence band. Alternatively, one of the 
transitions may involve the generation of a phonon (Figure 21.6c), wherein the as¬ 
sociated energy is dissipated in the form of heat. 

The intensity of the net absorbed radiation is dependent on the character of 
the medium as well as the path length within. The intensity of transmitted or 
nonabsorbed radiation I' T continuously decreases with distance % that the light 
traverses: 


T t = Ibe-P* (21.18) 

where F 0 is the intensity of the nonreflected incident radiation and /3, the absorp¬ 
tion coefficient (in mm -1 ), is characteristic of the particular material; furthermore, 
13 varies with wavelength of the incident radiation. The distance parameter x is meas¬ 
ured from the incident surface into the material. Materials that have large f3 values 
are considered highly absorptive.

21.8 TRANSMISSION

accounting for all 
absorption and 
reflection losses 


The phenomena of absorption, reflection, and transmission may be applied to the 
passage of light through a transparent solid, as shown in Figure 21.7. For an inci¬ 
dent beam of intensity I 0 that impinges on the front surface of a specimen of thick¬ 
ness / and absorption coefficient /3, the transmitted intensity at the back face I T is 

I T = I Q {\ - Rfe~ pl (21.19) 

where R is the reflectance; for this expression, it is assumed that the same medium 
exists outside both front and back faces. The derivation of Equation 21.19 is left as 
a homework problem. 

Thus, the fraction of incident light that is transmitted through a transparent ma¬ 
terial depends on the losses that are incurred by absorption and reflection. Again, the 
sum of the reflectivity R , absorptivity A , and transmissivity T, is unity according to 
Equation 21.5. Also, each of the variables R , A , and T depends on light wavelength. 
This is demonstrated over the visible region of the spectrum for a green glass in 
Figure 21.8. For example, for light having a wavelength of 0.4 pan, the fractions trans¬ 
mitted, absorbed, and reflected are approximately 0.90, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively. 
However, at 0.55 pan, the respective fractions have shifted to about 0.50,0.48, and 0.02.

the fractions of incident light transmitted, 
absorbed, and reflected through a green glass.

21.9 COLOR 

Transparent materials appear colored as a consequence of specific wavelength 
color ranges of light that are selectively absorbed; the color discerned is a result of the 

combination of wavelengths that are transmitted. If absorption is uniform for all 
visible wavelengths, the material appears colorless; examples include high-purity 
inorganic glasses and high-purity and single-crystal diamonds and sapphire. 

Usually, any selective absorption is by electron excitation. One such situation 
involves semiconducting materials that have band gaps within the range of photon 
energies for visible light (1.8 to 3.1 eV). Thus, the fraction of the visible light hav¬ 
ing energies greater than E g is selectively absorbed by valence band-conduction 
band electron transitions. Of course, some of this absorbed radiation is reemitted 
as the excited electrons drop back into their original, lower-lying energy states. It 
is not necessary that this reemission occur at the same frequency as that of the 
absorption. As a result, the color depends on the frequency distribution of both 
transmitted and reemitted light beams. 

For example, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has a band gap of about 2.4 eV; hence, it 
absorbs photons having energies greater than about 2.4 eV, which correspond to 
the blue and violet portions of the visible spectrum; some of this energy is reradi¬ 
ated as light having other wavelengths. Nonabsorbed visible light consists of pho¬ 
tons having energies between about 1.8 and 2.4 eV. Cadmium sulfide takes on a 
yellow-orange color because of the composition of the transmitted beam. 

With insulator ceramics, specific impurities also introduce electron levels within 
the forbidden band gap, as discussed previously. Photons having energies less than 
the band gap may be emitted as a consequence of electron decay processes involving 
impurity atoms or ions, as demonstrated in Figures 21 .6b and 21.6c. Again, the color 
of the material is a function of the distribution of wavelengths that is found in the 
transmitted beam. 

For example, high-purity and single-crystal aluminum oxide or sapphire is col¬ 
orless. Ruby, which has a brilliant red color, is simply sapphire to which has been 
added 0.5 to 2% chromium oxide (Cr 2 0 3 ). The Cr 3+ ion substitutes for the Al 3+ ion 
in the A1 2 0 3 crystal structure and, furthermore, introduces impurity levels within 
the wide energy band gap of the sapphire. Light radiation is absorbed by valence 
band-conduction band electron transitions, some of which is then reemitted at spe¬ 
cific wavelengths as a consequence of electron transitions to and from these impu¬ 
rity levels. The transmittance as a function of wavelength for sapphire and ruby is 
presented in Figure 21.9. For the sapphire, transmittance is relatively constant with 


Figure 21.9 Transmission of light radiation as a 
function of wavelength for sapphire (single-crystal 
aluminum oxide) and ruby (aluminum oxide 
containing some chromium oxide). The sapphire 
appears colorless, whereas the ruby has a red tint 
due to selective absorption over specific 
wavelength ranges. (Adapted from “The Optical

wavelength over the visible spectrum, which accounts for the colorlessness of this 
material. However, strong absorption peaks (or minima) occur for the ruby, one in 
the blue-violet region (at about 0.4 fxm), and the other for yellow-green light (at 
about 0.6 p,m). That nonabsorbed or transmitted light mixed with reemitted light 
imparts to ruby its deep-red color. 

Inorganic glasses are colored by incorporating transition or rare earth ions 
while the glass is still in the molten state. Representative color-ion pairs include 
Cu 2+ , blue-green; Co 2+ , blue-violet; Cr 3+ , green; Mn 2+ , yellow; and Mn 3+ , pur¬ 
ple. These colored glasses are also used as glazes and decorative coatings on 
ceramic ware.

21.10 OPACITY AND TRANSLUCENCY IN 
INSULATORS 

The extent of translucency and opacity for inherently transparent dielectric ma¬ 
terials depends to a great degree on their internal reflectance and transmittance 
characteristics. Many dielectric materials that are intrinsically transparent may 
be made translucent or even opaque because of interior reflection and refrac¬ 
tion. A transmitted light beam is deflected in direction and appears diffuse as a 
result of multiple scattering events. Opacity results when the scattering is so ex¬ 
tensive that virtually none of the incident beam is transmitted, undeflected, to 
the back surface. 

This internal scattering may result from several different sources. Polycrystalline 
specimens in which the index of refraction is anisotropic normally appear translu¬ 
cent. Both reflection and refraction occur at grain boundaries, which causes a 
diversion in the incident beam. This results from a slight difference in index of 
refraction n between adjacent grains that do not have the same crystallographic 
orientation. 

Scattering of light also occurs in two-phase materials in which one phase is 
finely dispersed within the other. Again, the beam dispersion occurs across phase 
boundaries when there is a difference in the refractive index for the two phases; 
the greater this difference, the more efficient the scattering. Glass-ceramics (Sec¬ 
tion 13.3), which may consist of both crystalline and residual glass phases, will appear 
highly transparent if the sizes of the crystallites are smaller than the wavelength of 
visible light, and when the indices of refraction of the two phases are nearly identical 
(which is possible by adjustment of composition). 

As a consequence of fabrication or processing, many ceramic pieces contain 
some residual porosity in the form of finely dispersed pores. These pores also 
effectively scatter light radiation. 

Figure 21.10 demonstrates the difference in optical transmission characteristics 
of single-crystal, fully dense polycrystalline, and porous (~5% porosity) aluminum 
oxide specimens. Whereas the single crystal is totally transparent, polycrystalline 
and porous materials are, respectively, translucent and opaque.

photography by S. Tanner.) 



For intrinsic polymers (without additives and impurities), the degree of translu- 
cency is influenced primarily by the extent of crystallinity. Some scattering of visi¬ 
ble light occurs at the boundaries between crystalline and amorphous regions, again 
as a result of different indices of refraction. For highly crystalline specimens, this 
degree of scattering is extensive, which leads to translucency, and, in some instances, 
even opacity. Highly amorphous polymers are completely transparent. 


Appl ications of Optical Phenomena 


21.11 LUMINESCENCE 


luminescence 


fluorescence 

phosphorescence 


Some materials are capable of absorbing energy and then reemitting visible light 
in a phenomenon called luminescence. Photons of emitted light are generated from 
electron transitions in the solid. Energy is absorbed when an electron is promoted 
to an excited energy state; visible light is emitted when it falls back to a lower energy 
state if 1.8 eV < hv < 3.1 eV. The absorbed energy may be supplied as higher-energy 
electromagnetic radiation (causing valence band-conduction band transitions, 
Figure 21.6a) such as ultraviolet light; other sources such as high-energy electrons; 
or heat, mechanical, or chemical energy. Furthermore, luminescence is classified ac¬ 
cording to the magnitude of the delay time between absorption and reemission 
events. If reemission occurs for times much less than one second, the phenomenon 
is termed fluorescence; for longer times, it is called phosphorescence. A number of 
materials can be made to fluoresce or phosphoresce; these include some sulfides, 
oxides, tungstates, and a few organic materials. Ordinarily, pure materials do not 
display these phenomena, and to induce them, impurities in controlled concentra¬ 
tions must be added. 

Luminescence has a number of commercial applications. Fluorescent lamps con¬ 
sist of a glass housing, coated on the inside with specially prepared tungstates or 
silicates. Ultraviolet light is generated within the tube from a mercury glow 
discharge, which causes the coating to fluoresce and emit white light. The picture 
viewed on a television screen (cathode ray tube screen) is the product of lumines¬ 
cence. The inside of the screen is coated with a material that fluoresces as an electron 
beam inside the picture tube very rapidly traverses the screen. Detection of x-rays 
and y-rays is also possible; certain phosphors emit visible light or glow when 
introduced into a beam of the radiation that is otherwise invisible.

MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Light-Emitting Diodes 


I n Section 18.15 we discussed semiconductor p-n 
junctions, and how they may be used as diodes 
or as rectifiers of an electric current. 1 Further¬ 
more, in some situations, when a forward-biased 
potential of relatively high magnitude is applied 
across a p-n junction diode, visible light (or in¬ 
frared radiation) will be emitted. This conversion 
of electrical energy into light energy is termed 
electroluminescence, and the device that produces 
it is termed a light-emitting diode (LED). The 
forward-biased potential attracts electrons on 
the n -side toward the junction, where some of 
them pass into (or are “injected” into) the p-side 
(Figure 21.11a). Here, the electrons are minority 
charge carriers and therefore “recombine” with, 
or are annihilated by, the holes in the region near 
the junction, according to Equation 21.17, where 
the energy is in the form of photons of light 
(Figure 21.115). An analogous process occurs on 
the p-side—holes travel to the junction and 
recombine with the majority electrons on the 
n- side. 

The elemental semiconductors, silicon and 
germanium, are not suitable for LEDs due to the 
detailed natures of their band gap structures. 
Rather, some of the III-V semiconducting com¬ 
pounds such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium 
phosphide (InP), and alloys composed of these 
materials (i.e., GaAs^P^, where x is a small num¬ 
ber less than unity) are frequently used. Further¬ 
more, the wavelength (i.e., color) of the emitted 
radiation is related to the band gap of the semi¬ 
conductor (which is the normally the same for 
both n- and p-sides of the diode). For example, 
red, orange, and yellow colors are possible for the 
GaAs-InP system. Blue and green LEDs have also 
been developed using (Ga,In)N semiconducting

tributions on both sides of the junction, with no ap¬

voltage behavior for a p-n junction. 


alloys. Thus, with this complement of colors, full- 
color displays are possible using LEDs. 

Several important applications for semicon¬ 
ductor LEDs include digital clocks and illuminated 
watch displays, optical mice (computer input 
devices), and film scanners. Electronic remote con¬ 
trols (for televisions, DVD players, etc.) also em¬ 
ploy LEDs that emit an infrared beam; this beam 
transmits coded signals that are picked up by de¬ 
tectors in the receiving devices. In addition, LEDs 
are now being used for light sources. They are 
more energy efficient than incandescent lights, 
generate very little heat, and have much longer 
lifetimes (because there is no filament that can 
burn out). Most new traffic control signals use 
LEDs instead of incandescent lights. 

We noted in Section 18.17 that some poly¬ 
meric materials may be semiconductors (both

n- and p- type). As a consequence, light-emitting 
diodes made of polymers are possible, of which 
there are two types: (1) organic light-emitting diodes 
(or OLEDs ), which have relatively low molecular 
weights; and (2) the high-molecular-weight 
polymer light-emitting diodes (or PLED s). For 
these LED types, amorphous polymers are used 
in the form of thin layers that are sandwiched 
together with electrical contacts (anodes and 
cathodes). In order for the light to be emitted 
from the LED, one of the contacts must be trans¬ 
parent. Figure 21.12 is a schematic illustration 
that shows the components and configuration of 
an OLED. A wide variety of colors is possible us¬ 
ing OLEDs and PLEDs, and more than a single 
color may be produced from each device (such is 
not possible with semiconductor LEDs)—thus, 
combining colors makes it possible to generate 
white light. 

Although the semiconductor LEDs cur¬ 
rently have longer lifetimes than these organic 
emitters, OLEDs/PLEDs have distinct advan¬ 
tages. In addition to generating multiple colors, 
they are easier to fabricate (by “printing” onto 
their substrates with an ink-jet printer), are rel¬ 
atively inexpensive, have slimmer profiles, and 
can be patterned to give high-resolution and 
full-color images. OLED displays are currently

21.12 PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY 

The conductivity of semiconducting materials depends on the number of free elec¬ 
trons in the conduction band and also the number of holes in the valence band, ac¬ 
cording to Equation 18.13. Thermal energy associated with lattice vibrations can 
promote electron excitations in which free electrons and/or holes are created, as 
described in Section 18.6. Additional charge carriers may be generated as a conse¬ 
quence of photon-induced electron transitions in which light is absorbed; the at- 
photoconductivity tendant increase in conductivity is called photoconductivity. Thus, when a specimen 
of a photoconductive material is illuminated, the conductivity increases. 

This phenomenon is used in photographic light meters. A photoinduced current 
is measured, and its magnitude is a direct function of the intensity of the incident 
light radiation, or the rate at which the photons of light strike the photoconductive 
material. Of course, visible light radiation must induce electronic transitions in the 
photoconductive material; cadmium sulfide is commonly used in light meters. 

Sunlight may be directly converted into electrical energy in solar cells, which 
also employ semiconductors. The operation of these devices is, in a sense, the re¬ 
verse of that for the light-emitting diode. A p-n junction is used in which photoex- 
cited electrons and holes are drawn away from the junction, in opposite directions, 
and become part of an external current, as illustrated in the ( a ) chapter-opening 
diagram for this chapter.

21.13 LASERS 

All the radiative electron transitions heretofore discussed are spontaneous; that is, 
an electron falls from a high energy state to a lower one without any external provo¬ 
cation. These transition events occur independently of one another and at random 
times, producing radiation that is incoherent; that is, the light waves are out of phase 
with one another. With lasers, however, coherent light is generated by electron tran- 
laser sitions initiated by an external stimulus; in fact, laser is just the acronym for /ight 

amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. 

Although there are several different varieties of laser, the principles of opera¬ 
tion are explained using the solid-state ruby laser. Ruby is simply a single crystal 
of A1 2 0 3 (sapphire) to which has been added on the order of 0.05% Cr 3+ ions. As 
previously explained (Section 21.9), these ions impart to ruby its characteristic red 
color; more important, they provide electron states that are essential for the laser 
to function. The ruby laser is in the form of a rod, the ends of which are flat, par¬ 
allel, and highly polished. Both ends are silvered such that one is totally reflecting 
and the other partially transmitting. 

The ruby is illuminated with light from a xenon flash lamp (Figure 21.13). 
Before this exposure, virtually all the Cr 3+ ions are in their ground states; that is, 
electrons fill the lowest energy levels, as represented schematically in Figure 21.14. 
However, photons of wavelength 0.56 jxm from the xenon lamp excite electrons 
from the Cr 3+ ions into higher energy states. These electrons can decay back into

their ground state by two different paths. Some fall back directly; associated pho¬ 
ton emissions are not part of the laser beam. Other electrons decay into a 
metastable intermediate state (path EM, Figure 21.14), where they may reside for 
up to 3 ms (milliseconds) before spontaneous emission (path MG). In terms of 
electronic processes, 3 ms is a relatively long time, which means that a large num¬ 
ber of these metastable states may become occupied. This situation is indicated 
in Figure 21.15 b. 

The initial spontaneous photon emission by a few of these electrons is the stim¬ 
ulus that triggers an avalanche of emissions from the remaining electrons in the 
metastable state (Figure 21.15c). Of the photons directed parallel to the long axis 
of the ruby rod, some are transmitted through the partially silvered end; others, in¬ 
cident to the totally silvered end, are reflected. Photons that are not emitted in this 
axial direction are lost. The light beam repeatedly travels back and forth along the 
rod length, and its intensity increases as more emissions are stimulated. Ultimately, 
a high intensity, coherent, and highly collimated laser light beam of short duration 
is transmitted through the partially silvered end of the rod (Figure 21.15c). This 
monochromatic red beam has a wavelength of 0.6943 p,m.

Semiconducting materials such as gallium arsenide may also be used as lasers 
that are employed in compact disc players and in the modern telecommunications 
industry. One requirement of these semiconducting materials is that the wavelength 
A associated with the band gap energy E g must correspond to visible light. That is, 
from a modification of Equation 21.3, namely 

A = ^ (21.20) 

h g 

the value of A must lie between 0.4 and 0.7 pan. A voltage applied to the material 
excites electrons from the valence band, across the band gap, and into the conduc¬ 
tion band; correspondingly, holes are created in the valence band. This process is 
demonstrated in Figure 21.16a, which shows the energy band scheme over some re¬ 
gion of the semiconducting material, along with several holes and excited electrons. 
Subsequently, a few of these excited electrons and holes spontaneously recombine. 
For each recombination event, a photon of light having a wavelength given by Equa¬ 
tion 21.20 is emitted (Figure 21.16a). One such photon will stimulate the recombi¬ 
nation of other excited electron-hole pairs, Figure 2116b-f, and the production of 
additional photons that have the same wavelength and are all in phase with one 
another and with the original photon; thus, a monochromatic and coherent beam 
results. As with the ruby laser (Figure 21.15), one end of the semiconductor laser is 
totally reflecting; at this end, the beam is reflected back into the material so that

additional recombinations will be stimulated. The other end of the laser is partially 
reflecting, which allows for some of the beam to escape. Furthermore, with this type 
of laser, a continuous beam is produced inasmuch as a constant applied voltage en¬ 
sures that there is always a steady source of holes and excited electrons. 

The semiconductor laser is composed of several layers of semiconducting materials 
that have different compositions and are sandwiched between a heat sink and a metal 
conductor; a typical arrangement is represented schematically in Figure 21.17. The com¬ 
positions of the layers are chosen so as to confine both the excited electrons and holes 
as well as the laser beam to within the central gallium arsenide layer.

applications are diverse. Because laser beams may be focused to produce localized

systems. Furthermore, because the beam is highly coherent, they may be used for

21.14 OPTICAL FIBERS IN COMMUNICATIONS 

The communications field has recently experienced a revolution with the develop¬ 
ment of optical fiber technology; at present, virtually all telecommunications are trans¬ 
mitted via this medium rather than through copper wires. Signal transmission through 
a metallic wire conductor is electronic (i.e., by electrons), whereas using optically 
transparent fibers, signal transmission is photonic , meaning that it uses photons of 
electromagnetic or light radiation. Use of fiber-optic systems has improved speed of 
transmission, information density, and transmission distance, with a reduction in error 
rate; furthermore, there is no electromagnetic interference with fiber optics. With re¬ 
gard to speed, optical fibers can transmit, in one second, information equivalent to 
three episodes of your favorite television program. Or relative to information density, 
two small optical fibers can transmit the equivalent of 24,000 telephone calls simul¬ 
taneously. Furthermore, it would require 30,000 kg (33 tons) of copper to transmit 
the same amount of information as only 0.1 kg (^lb m ) of optical fiber material. 

The present treatment will center on the characteristics of optical fibers; how¬ 
ever, it is worthwhile to first briefly discuss the components and operation of the 
transmission system. A schematic diagram showing these components is presented in 
Figure 21.18. The information (i.e., telephone conversation) in electronic form must 
first be digitized into bits, that is, Is and 0s; this is accomplished in the encoder. It is 
next necessary to convert this electrical signal into an optical (photonic) one, which 
takes place in the electrical-to-optical converter (Figure 21.18). This converter is nor¬ 
mally a semiconductor laser, as described in the previous section, which emits mono¬ 
chromatic and coherent light. The wavelength normally lies between 0.78 and 1.6 p,m, 
which is in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum; absorption losses are 
low within this range of wavelengths. The output from this laser converter is in the 
form of pulses of light; a binary 1 is represented by a high-power pulse (Figure 21.19a), 
whereas a 0 corresponds to a low-power pulse (or the absence of one), Figure 21.19Z>.

These photonic pulse signals are then fed into and carried through the fiber-optic 
cable (sometimes called a waveguide) to the receiving end. For long transmissions, 
repeaters may be required; these are devices that amplify and regenerate the signal. 
Finally, at the receiving end the photonic signal is reconverted to an electronic one 
and then decoded (undigitized). 

The heart of this communication system is the optical fiber. It must guide these 
light pulses over long distances without significant signal power loss (i.e., attenua¬ 
tion) and pulse distortion. Fiber components are the core, cladding, and coating; 
these are represented in the cross-section profile shown in Figure 21.20. The signal 
passes through the core, whereas the surrounding cladding constrains the light rays 
to travel within the core; the outer coating protects core and cladding from dam¬ 
age that might result from abrasion and external pressures. 

High-purity silica glass is used as the fiber material; fiber diameters normally 
range between about 5 and 100 jxm. The fibers are relatively flaw-free and, thus, re¬ 
markably strong; during production the continuous fibers are tested to ensure that 
they meet minimum strength standards. 

Containment of the light to within the fiber core is made possible by total in¬ 
ternal reflection; that is, any light rays traveling at oblique angles to the fiber axis 
are reflected back into the core. Internal reflection is accomplished by varying the 
index of refraction of the core and cladding glass materials. In this regard, two de¬ 
sign types are employed. With one type (termed step-index ), the index of refrac¬ 
tion of the cladding is slightly lower than that of the core. The index profile and the 
manner of internal reflection are shown in Figures 21.215 and 21.21d. For this de¬ 
sign, the output pulse will be broader than the input one (Figures 21.21c and c), a

phenomenon that is undesirable because it limits the rate of transmission. Pulse 
broadening results because various light rays, although being injected at approxi¬ 
mately the same instant, arrive at the output at different times; they traverse dif¬ 
ferent trajectories and, thus, have a variety of path lengths. 

Pulse broadening is largely avoided by use of the other or graded-index design. 
Here, impurities such as boron oxide (B 2 0 3 ) or germanium dioxide (Ge0 2 ) are added 
to the silica glass such that the index of refraction is made to vary parabolically across 
the cross section (Figure 21.22b). Thus, the velocity of light within the core varies with 
radial position, being greater at the periphery than at the center. Consequently, light 
rays that traverse longer path lengths through the outer periphery of the core travel 
faster in this lower-index material and arrive at the output at approximately the same 
time as undeviated rays that pass through the center portion of the core. 

Exceptionally pure and high-quality fibers are fabricated using advanced and so¬ 
phisticated processing techniques, which will not be discussed here. Impurities and 
other defects that absorb, scatter, and thus attenuate the light beam must be elimi¬ 
nated. The presence of copper, iron, and vanadium is especially detrimental; their con¬ 
centrations are reduced to on the order of several parts per billion. Likewise, water 
and hydroxyl contaminant contents are extremely low. Uniformity of fiber cross- 
sectional dimensions and core roundness are critical; tolerances of these parameters 
to within a micrometer over 1 km (0.6 mile) of length are possible. In addition, bubbles 
within the glass and surface defects have been virtually eliminated. The attenuation of 
light in this glass material is imperceptibly small. For example, the power loss through 
a 16-kilometer (10-mile) thickness of optical-fiber glass is equivalent to the power loss 
through a 25-millimeter (1-inch) thickness of ordinary window glass! 


SUMMARY 


Electromagnetic Radiation 

• The optical behavior of a solid material is a function of its interactions with 
electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths within the visible region of the 
spectrum (about 0.4 jxm to 0.7 |xm). 

• From a quantum-mechanical perspective, electromagnetic radiation may be 
considered to be composed of photons—groups or packets of energy that are 
quantized, that is, they can have only specific values of energy. 

















866 * Chapter 21 / Optical Properties 

• Photon energy is equal to the product of Planck’s constant and radiation fre¬ 
quency (Equation 21.3). 

Light Interactions with Solids 

• Possible interactive phenomena that may occur as light radiation passes from one 
medium to another are refraction, reflection, absorption, and transmission. 

• Regarding degree of light transmissivity, materials are classified as follows: 

Transparent—light is transmitted through the material with very little 
absorption and reflection. 

Translucent—light is transmitted diffusely; there is some scattering within the 
interior of the material. 

Opaque—virtually all light is scattered or reflected such that none is trans¬ 
mitted through the material. 

Atomic and Electronic Interactions 

• One possible interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter is elec¬ 
tronic polarization—the electric field component of a light wave induces a shift 
of the electron cloud around an atom relative to its nucleus (Figure 18.32a). 

• Two consequences of electronic polarization are absorption and refraction of light. 

• Electromagnetic radiation may be absorbed by causing the excitation of electrons 
from one energy state to a higher state (Figure 21.3). 

Optical Properties of Metals 

• Metals appear opaque as a result of the absorption and then reemission of light 
radiation within a thin outer surface layer. 

• Absorption occurs via the excitation of electrons from occupied energy states to 
unoccupied ones above the Fermi energy level (Figure 21.4a). Reemission takes 
place by decay electron transitions in the reverse direction (Figure 21.45). 

• The perceived color of a metal is determined by the spectral composition of the 
reflected light. 

Refraction 

• Light radiation experiences refraction in transparent materials; that is, its velocity 
is retarded and the light beam is bent at the interface. 

• The phenomenon of refraction is a consequence of electronic polarization of the 
atoms or ions. The larger an atom or ion, the greater the index of refraction. 

Reflection 

• When light passes from one transparent medium to another having a different 
index of refraction, some of it is reflected at the interface. 

• The degree of the reflectance depends on the indices of refraction of both me¬ 
dia, as well as the angle of incidence. For normal incidence, reflectivity may be 
calculated using Equation 21.12. 

Absorption 

• Pure nonmetallic materials are either intrinsically transparent or opaque. 

Opacity results in relatively narrow-band-gap materials ( E g <1.8 eV) as a 
result of absorption whereby a photon’s energy is sufficient to promote 
valence band-conduction band electron transitions (Figure 21.5). 


Summary * 867 


Transparent nonmetals have band gaps greater than 3.1 eV. 

For nonmetallic materials that have band gaps between 1.8 and 3.1 eV, only 
a portion of the visible spectrum is absorbed; these materials appear 
colored. 

• Some light absorption occurs in even transparent materials as a consequence of 
electronic polarization. 

• For wide-band-gap insulators that contain impurities, decay processes involving 
excited electrons to states within the band gap are possible with the emission of 
photons having energies less than the band gap energy (Figure 21.6). 

Color 

• Transparent materials appear colored as a consequence of specific wavelength 
ranges of light that are selectively absorbed (usually by electron excitations). 

• The color discerned is a result of the distribution of wavelength ranges in the 
transmitted beam. 

Opacity and Translucency in Insulators 

• Normally transparent materials may be made translucent or even opaque if the 
incident light beam experiences interior reflection and/or refraction. 

• Translucency and opacity as a result of internal scattering may occur 

(1) in polycrystalline materials that have anisotropic indices of refraction; 

(2) in two-phase materials; 

(3) in materials containing small pores; and 

(4) in highly crystalline polymers. 

Luminescence 

• With luminescence, energy is absorbed as a consequence of electron excitations, 
which is subsequently reemitted as visible light. 

When light is reemitted in less than a second after excitation, the phenome¬ 
non is called fluorescence. 

For longer reemission times, the term phosphorescence is used. 

• Electroluminescence is the phenomenon whereby light is emitted as a result of 
electron-hole recombination events that are induced in a forward-biased diode 
(Figure 21.11). 

• The device that experiences electroluminescence is the light-emitting diode 
(LED). 

Photoconductivity 

• Photoconductivity is the phenomenon whereby the electrical conductivity of some 
semiconductors may be enhanced by photo-induced electron transitions, whereby 
additional free electrons and holes are generated. 

Lasers 

• Coherent and high-intensity light beams are produced in lasers by stimulated 
electron transitions. 

• With the ruby laser, a beam is generated by electrons that decay back into their 
ground Cr 3+ states from metastable excited states. 

• The beam from a semiconducting laser results from the recombination of excited 
electrons in the conduction band with valence band holes. 


868 * Chapter 21 / Optical Properties 

Optical Fibers in Communications 

• Use of fiber-optic technology in our modern telecommunications provides for the 
transmission of information that is interference free, rapid, and intense. 

• An optical fiber is composed of the following elements: 

A core through which the pulses of light propagate 

The cladding, which provides for total internal reflection and containment of 
the light beam within the core 

The coating, which protects the core and cladding from damage

WHY STUDY Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials 
Science and Engineering? 


It is essential for the engineer to know about and 
understand economic issues simply because the company/ 
institution for which he or she works must realize a 
profit from the products it manufactures. Materials 
engineering decisions have economic consequences 
with regard to both material and production costs. 

An awareness of environmental and societal issues 
is important for the engineer because, over time, 
greater demands are being made on the world's natural 


resources. Furthermore, levels of pollution are ever 
increasing. Materials engineering decisions have impacts 
on the consumption of raw materials and energy, on 
the contamination of our water and atmosphere, on 
human health, on global climate change, and on the 
ability of the consumer to recycle or dispose of spent 
products. The quality of life for this and future genera¬ 
tions will depend, to some degree, on how these issues 
are addressed by the global engineering community. 


Learning Objectives 

After studying this chapter you should be able to do the following: 


1. List and briefly discuss three factors over which 
an engineer has control that affect the cost of 
a product. 

2. Diagram the total materials cycle, and briefly 
discuss relevant issues that pertain to each 
stage of this cycle. 

3. List the two inputs and five outputs for the life 
cycle analysis/assessment scheme. 


4. Cite issues that are relevant to the "green 
design" philosophy of product design. 

5. Discuss recyclability/disposability issues relative 
to (a) metals, (b) glass, (c) plastics and rubber, 
and (d) composite materials. 


22.1 INTRODUCTION 

In previous chapters, we dealt with a variety of materials science and materials en¬ 
gineering issues to include criteria that may be employed in the materials selection 
process. Many of these selection criteria relate to material properties or property 
combinations—mechanical, electrical, thermal, corrosion, and so on; the perform¬ 
ance of some component will depend on the properties of the material from which 
it is made. Processability or ease of fabrication of the component may also play a 
role in the selection process. Virtually all of this book, in one way or another, has 
addressed these property and fabrication issues. 

In engineering practice, other important criteria must be considered in the de¬ 
velopment of a marketable product. Some of these are economic in nature, which, 
to some degree, are unrelated to scientific principles and engineering practice, and 
yet are significant if a product is to be competitive in the commercial marketplace. 
Other criteria that should be addressed involve environmental and societal issues 
such as pollution, disposal, recycling, toxicity, and energy. This final chapter offers 
relatively brief overviews of economic, environmental, and societal considerations 
that are important in engineering practice. 

Economic Considerations 


Engineering practice involves using scientific principles to design components and 
systems that perform reliably and satisfactorily. Another critical driving force in en¬ 
gineering practice is that of economics; simply stated, the company or institution 


• 873 







874 * Chapter 22 / Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials Science 


must realize a profit from the products that it manufactures and sells. The engineer 
may design the perfect component; however, as manufactured, it must be offered 
for sale at a price that is attractive to the consumer and return a suitable profit to 
the company. 

Furthermore, in today’s world and the global marketplace, economics doesn’t 
always mean just the final cost of a product. Many countries have specific regu¬ 
lations regarding the chemicals used, C0 2 emissions, and end-of-life procedures. 
Companies must consider a myriad of such factors. For example, in some instances, 
deleting toxic chemicals (which are regulated) in a product results in a cheaper 
fabrication process. 

Only a brief overview of important economic considerations as they apply to 
the materials engineer will be provided. The student may want to consult refer¬ 
ences provided at the end of this chapter that address engineering economics in 
detail. 

The materials engineer has control over three factors that affect the cost of a 
product: (1) component design, (2) the material(s) used, and (3) the manufacturing 
technique(s) that are employed. These factors are interrelated in that component 
design may affect which material is used, and both component design and the 
material used will influence the choice of manufacturing technique(s). Economic 
considerations for each of these factors is now briefly discussed. 

22.2 COMPONENT DESIGN 

Some fraction of the cost of a component is associated with its design. In this con¬ 
text, component design is the specification of size, shape, and configuration, which 
will affect in-service component performance. For example, if mechanical forces are 
present, then stress analyses may be required. Detailed drawings of the component 
must be prepared; computers are normally employed, using software that has been 
generated for this specific function. 

A single component is often part of a complex device or system consisting of 
a large number of components (the television, automobile, DVD player/recorder, 
etc.). Thus, design must take into consideration each component’s contribution to 
the efficient operation of the complete system. 

The approximate cost of a product is determined by this up-front design, even 
before the product has been manufactured. Thus, employment of a creative design 
and the selection of appropriate materials can have a significant impact later on. 

Component design is a highly iterative process that involves many compromises 
and trade-offs. The engineer should keep in mind that an optimal component de¬ 
sign may not be possible because of system constraints. 

22.3 MATERIALS 

In terms of economics, we want to select the material or materials with the appro¬ 
priate combination(s) of properties that are the least expensive, which may also in¬ 
clude consideration of availability. Once a family of materials has been selected that 
satisfy the design constraints, cost comparisons of the various candidate materials 
may be made on the basis of cost per part. Material price is usually quoted per unit 
mass. The part volume may be determined from its dimensions and geometry, which 
is then converted into mass using the density of the material. In addition, during 
manufacturing there is ordinarily some unavoidable material waste, which should 
also be taken into account in these computations. Current prices for a wide variety 
of engineering materials are contained in Appendix C. 


Environmental and Societal Considerations * 875 


22.4 MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES 

As already stated, the choice of manufacturing process will be influenced by both 
the material selected and part design. The entire manufacturing process will nor¬ 
mally consist of primary and secondary operations. Primary operations are those 
that convert the raw material into a recognizable part (casting, plastic forming, pow¬ 
der compaction, molding, etc.), whereas secondary ones are those subsequently em¬ 
ployed to produce the finished part (e.g., heat treatments, welding, grinding, drilling, 
painting, decorating). The major cost considerations for these processes include cap¬ 
ital equipment, tooling, labor, repairs, machine downtime, and waste. Of course, 
within this cost analysis, rate of production is an important consideration. If this 
particular part is one component of a system, then assembly costs must also be ad¬ 
dressed. Finally, there will undoubtedly be costs associated with inspection, pack¬ 
aging, and transportation of the final product. 

As a sidelight, there are also other factors not directly related to design, mate¬ 
rial, or manufacturing that figure into the product selling price. These factors in¬ 
clude labor fringe benefits, supervisory and management labor, research and de¬ 
velopment, property and rent, insurance, profit, taxes, and so on. 


Environmental and Societal 
Considerations 

Our modern technologies and the manufacturing of their associated products im¬ 
pact our societies in a variety of ways—some are positive, others are adverse. Fur¬ 
thermore, these impacts are economic and environmental in type, and international 
in scope inasmuch as (1) the resources required for a new technology often come 
from many different countries, (2) the economic prosperity resulting from techno¬ 
logical development is global in extent, and (3) environmental impacts may extend 
beyond the boundaries of a single country. 

Materials play a crucial role in this technology-economy-environment scheme. 
A material that is used in some end product and then discarded passes through sev¬ 
eral stages or phases; these stages are represented in Figure 22.1, which is some¬ 
times termed the total materials cycle or just materials cycle and represents the “cra- 
dle-to-grave” life circuit of a material. Beginning on the far left side of Figure 22.1, 
raw materials are extracted from their natural earthly habitats by mining, drilling, 
harvesting, and so on. These raw materials are then purified, refined, and converted 
into bulk forms such as metals, cements, petroleum, rubber, and fibers. Further syn¬ 
thesis and processing results in products that are what may be termed engineered 
materials; examples include metal alloys, ceramic powders, glass, plastics, compos¬ 
ites, semiconductors, and elastomers. Next, these engineered materials are further 
shaped, treated, and assembled into products, devices, and appliances that are ready 
for the consumer—this constitutes the “product design, manufacture, assembly” 
stage of Figure 22.1. The consumer purchases these products and uses them (the 
“applications” stage) until they wear out or become obsolete, and are discarded. At 
this time the product constituents may either be recycled/reused (whereby they 
reenter the materials cycle) or disposed of as waste, normally being either inciner¬ 
ated or dumped as solid waste in municipal landfills—and so they return to the earth 
and complete the materials cycle.

It has been estimated that worldwide, about 15 billion tons of raw materials are 
extracted from the earth every year; some of these are renewable and some are not. 
Over time, it is becoming more apparent that the earth is virtually a closed system 
relative to its constituent materials and that its resources are finite. In addition, as 
our societies mature and populations increase, the available resources become 
scarcer, and greater attention must be paid to more effective use of these resources 
relative to the materials cycle. 

Furthermore, energy must be supplied at each cycle stage; in the United States 
it has been estimated that approximately one-half of the energy consumed by 
manufacturing industries goes to produce and fabricate materials. Energy is a re¬ 
source that, to some degree, is limited in supply, and measures must be taken to 
conserve and more effectively use it in the production, application, and disposal 
of materials. 

Finally, there are interactions with and impacts on the natural environment at 
all stages of the materials cycle. The condition of the earth’s atmosphere, water, and 
land depends to a large extent on how carefully we traverse the materials cycle. 
Some ecological damage and landscape spoilage undoubtedly result during the ex¬ 
traction of raw materials. Pollutants may be generated that are expelled into the air 
and water during synthesis and processing; in addition, any toxic chemicals that are 
produced need to be disposed of or discarded. The final product, device, or appli¬ 
ance should be designed so that during its lifetime, any impact on the environment 
is minimal; furthermore, at the end of its life, provision should be made for recy¬ 
cling its component materials, or at least for their disposal with little ecological 
impact (i.e., it should be biodegradable). 

Recycling of used products rather than disposing of them as waste is a desir¬ 
able approach for several reasons. First of all, using recycled material obviates the 
need to extract raw materials from the earth and thus conserves natural resources 












Environmental and Societal Considerations * 877 


and eliminates any associated ecological impact from the extraction phase. Second, 
energy requirements for the refinement and processing of recycled materials are 
normally less than for their natural counterparts; for example, approximately 28 
times as much energy is required to refine natural aluminum ores as to recycle 
aluminum beverage can scrap. Finally, there is no need to dispose of recycled 
materials. 

Thus, the materials cycle (Figure 22.1) is really a system that involves interac¬ 
tions and exchanges among materials, energy, and the environment. Furthermore, 
future engineers, worldwide, must understand the interrelationships among these 
various stages so as to effectively use the earth’s resources and minimize adverse 
ecological affects on our environment. 

In many countries, environmental problems and issues are being addressed by 
the establishment of standards that are mandated by governmental regulatory agen¬ 
cies (e.g., the use of lead in electronic components is being phased out). Further¬ 
more, from an industrial perspective, it becomes incumbent on engineers to propose 
viable solutions to existing and potential environmental concerns. 

Correcting any environmental problems associated with manufacturing will 
influence product price. A common misconception is that a more environmen¬ 
tally friendly product or process will inherently be more costly than one that is 
environmentally unfriendly. Engineers who use “out-of-the-box” thinking can 
generate better and cheaper products/processes. Another consideration relates 
to how one defines cost; in this regard it is essential to look at the entire life 
cycle and take into account all relevant factors (including disposal and environ¬ 
mental impact issues). 

One approach that is being implemented by industry to improve the environ¬ 
mental performance of products is termed life cycle analysis/assessment. With this 
approach to product design, consideration is given to the cradle-to-grave environ¬ 
mental assessment of the product, from material extraction to product manufacture 
to product use, and, finally, to recycling and disposal; sometimes this approach is 
also labeled green design. One important phase of this approach is to quantify the 
various inputs (i.e., materials and energy) and outputs (i.e., wastes) for each phase 
of the life cycle; this is represented schematically in Figure 22.2. In addition, an as¬ 
sessment is conducted relative to the impact on both global and local environments 
in terms of the effects on ecology, human health, and resource reserves.

assessment of a product. (Adapted from J. L.

One of the current environmental/economic/societal buzzwords is sustainabil¬ 
ity. In this context, sustainability represents the ability to maintain an acceptable 
lifestyle at the present level and into the indefinite future while preserving the en¬ 
vironment. This means that over time and as populations increase in size, the earth’s 
resources must be used at a rate such that they can be replenished naturally and 
that emission levels of pollutants are maintained at acceptable levels. For engineers 
this concept of sustainability translates into being responsible for the development 
of sustainable products. An internationally accepted standard, ISO 14001, has been 
established to help organizations comply with applicable laws and regulations and 
address the delicate balance between being profitable and reducing impacts on the 
environment. 1 

22.5 RECYCLING ISSUES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE 
AND ENGINEERING 

Important stages in the materials cycle where materials science and engineering 
plays a significant role are recycling and disposal. The issues of recyclability and dis¬ 
posability are important when new materials are being designed and synthesized. 
Furthermore, during the materials selection process, the ultimate disposition of the 
materials employed should be an important criterion. Let us conclude this section 
by briefly discussing several of these recyclability/disposability issues. 

From an environmental perspective, the ideal material should be either totally 
recyclable or completely biodegradable. Recyclable means that a material, after com¬ 
pleting its life cycle in one component, could be reprocessed, could reenter the ma¬ 
terials cycle, and could be reused in another component—a process that could be 
repeated an indefinite number of times. By completely biodegradable , we mean that, 
by interactions with the environment (natural chemicals, microorganisms, oxygen, 
heat, sunlight, etc.), the material deteriorates and returns to virtually the same state 
in which it existed prior to the initial processing. Engineering materials exhibit vary¬ 
ing degrees of recyclability and biodegradability. 

Metals 

Most metal alloys (i.e., Fe, Cu), to one degree or another experience corrosion and 
are also biodegradable. However, some metals (i.e., Hg, Pb) are toxic and, when 
placed in landfills, may present health hazards. Furthermore, alloys of most metals 
are recyclable; on the other hand, it is not feasible to recycle all alloys of every 
metal. In addition, the quality of alloys that are recycled tends to diminish with each 
cycle. 

Product designs should allow for the dismantling of components composed of 
different alloys. Another problem with recycling involves separation of various al¬ 
loy types (i.e., aluminum from ferrous alloys) after dismantling and shredding; in 
this regard, some rather ingenious separation techniques have been devised (i.e., 
magnetic and gravity). Joining of dissimilar alloys presents contamination problems; 
for example, if two similar alloys are to be joined, welding is preferred over bolt¬ 
ing or riveting. Coatings (paints, anodized layers, claddings, etc.) may also act as 
contaminants and render the material nonrecyclable. These examples illustrate why

body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations that 
establishes and disseminates industrial and commercial standards. 



22.5 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering * 879 

it is so important to consider the entire life cycle of a product at the beginning stages 
of its design. 

Aluminum alloys are very corrosion resistant and, therefore, nonbiodegradable. 
Fortunately, however, they may be recycled; in fact, aluminum is the most impor¬ 
tant recyclable nonferrous metal. Because aluminum is not easily corroded, it may 
be totally reclaimed. A low ratio of energy is required to refine recycled aluminum 
relative to its primary production. In addition, a large number of commercially 
available alloys have been designed to accommodate impurity contamination. The 
primary sources of recycled aluminum are used beverage cans and scrapped 
automobiles. 

Glass 

The one ceramic material that is consumed by the general public in the greatest 
quantities is glass, in the form of containers. Glass is a relatively inert material, and, 
as such, it does not decompose; thus, it is not biodegradable. A significant propor¬ 
tion of municipal landfills consists of waste glass; so also does incinerator residue. 

In addition, there is no significant economic driving force for recycling glass. Its 
basic raw materials (sand, soda ash, and limestone) are inexpensive and readily 
available. Furthermore, salvaged glass (also called cullet ) must be sorted by color 
(clear, amber, and green), by type (plate versus container), and by composition (lime, 
lead, and borosilicate [or Pyrex]); these sorting procedures are time-consuming and 
expensive. Therefore, scrap glass has a low market value, which diminishes its 
recyclability. Advantages of using recycled glass include more rapid and increased 
production rates and a reduction in pollutant emissions. 

Plastics and Rubber 

One reason that synthetic polymers (including rubber) are so popular as engineer¬ 
ing materials is their chemical and biological inertness. On the down side, this char¬ 
acteristic is really a liability when it comes to waste disposal. Most polymers are not 
biodegradable, and, therefore, don’t biodegrade in landfills; major sources of waste 
are from packaging, junk automobiles, automobile tires, and domestic durables. 
Biodegradable polymers have been synthesized, but they are relatively expensive 
to produce (see the Materials of Importance box that follows). On the other hand, 
because some polymers are combustible and do not yield appreciable toxic or pol¬ 
luting emissions, they may be disposed of by incineration. 

Thermoplastic polymers, specifically poly (ethylene terephthalate), polyethyl¬ 
ene, and polypropylene, are those most amenable to reclamation and recycling, be¬ 
cause they may be re-formed upon heating. Sorting by type and color is necessary. 
In some countries, type sorting of packaging materials is facilitated using a number 
identification code; for example, a “1” denotes poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET 
or PETE). Table 22.1 presents these recycling code numbers and their associated 
materials. Also included in the table are uses of virgin and recycled materials. Plas¬ 
tics recycling is complicated by the presence of fillers (Section 15.21) that were 
added to modify the original properties. The recycled plastic is less costly than the 
original material, and quality and appearance are generally degraded with each re¬ 
cycle. Typical applications for recycled plastics include shoe soles, tool handles, and 
industrial products such as pallets. 

The recycling of thermoset resins is much more difficult because these materi¬ 
als are not easily remolded or reshaped because of their crosslinked or network 
structures. Some thermosets are ground up and added to the virgin molding material 
prior to processing; therefore, they are recycled as filler materials.

Rubber materials present some disposal and recycling challenges. When vul¬ 
canized, they are thermoset materials, which makes chemical recycling difficult. In 
addition, they may also contain a variety of fillers. The major source of rubber scrap 
in the United States is discarded automobile tires, which are highly nonbiodegrad- 
able. Scrap tires have been used as a fuel for some industrial applications (i.e., ce¬ 
ment plants) but yield dirty emissions. Recycled rubber tires that have been split 
and reshaped are used in a variety of applications such as automotive bumper 
guards, mud flaps, doormats, and conveyor rollers; and, of course, used tires may 
also be recapped. In addition, rubber tires may be ground into small chunks that 
are then recombined into the desired shape using some type of adhesive; the re¬ 
sulting material may be used in a number of nondemanding applications such as 
placemats and rubber toys. 

The most viable recyclable alternatives to the traditional rubber materials are 
the thermoplastic elastomers (Section 15.19). Being thermoplastic in nature they 
are not chemically crosslinked and, thus, are easily reshaped. Furthermore, pro¬ 
duction energy requirements are lower than for the thermoset rubbers because a 
vulcanization step is not required in their manufacture. 

Composite Materials 

Composites are inherently difficult to recycle because they are multiphase in na¬ 
ture. The two or more phases/materials that constitute the composite are normally 
intermixed on a very fine scale, and trying to separate them complicates the recycling 





22.5 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering * 881 

process. However, some techniques have been developed, with modest success, for 
recycling polymer-matrix composites. Recycling technologies will differ only slightly 
for thermoset-matrix and thermoplastic-matrix composite materials. 

The first step in recycling both thermoset- and thermoplastic-matrix composites 
is shredding/grinding, wherein the components are reduced in size to relatively small 
particles. In some instances, these ground particles are used as filler materials that 
are blended with a polymer (and perhaps other fillers) before fabrication (usually 
using some type of molding technique) into postconsumer products. Other recycling 
processes allow for separating of the fibers and/or matrix materials. With some tech¬ 
niques the matrix is volatilized; with others it is recovered as a monomer. Of course, 
the recovered fibers have short lengths as a result of the shredding/grinding process. 
In addition, fibers will experience a reduction of mechanical strength, the degree 
of which will depend on the specific recovery process as well as fiber type. 


MATERIALS OF IMPORTANCE 

Biodegradable and Biorenewable Polymers/Plastics 


M ost of the polymers manufactured today are 
synthetic and petroleum based. These syn¬ 
thetic materials (e.g., polyethylene and poly¬ 
styrene) are extremely stable and resistant to 
degradation, particularly in moist environments. 
In the 1970s and 1980s it was feared that the large 
volume of plastic waste being generated would 
contribute to the filling of all available landfill 
capacity. Thus, the resistance to degradation of 
polymers was viewed as a liability rather than as 
an asset. The introduction of biodegradable poly¬ 
mers was perceived as a means to eliminate some 
of this landfill waste, and the response of the poly¬ 
mer industry was to start developing biodegrad¬ 
able materials. 

Biodegradable polymers are those that degrade 
naturally in the environment, normally by microbial 
action. With regard to degradation mechanism, mi¬ 
crobes sever polymer chain bonds, which leads to a 
decrease in molecular size; these smaller molecules 
may then be ingested by microbes, in a process that 
is similar to the composting of plants. Of course, nat¬ 
ural polymers such as wool, cotton, and wood are 
biodegradable inasmuch as microbes can readily di¬ 
gest these materials. 

The first generation of these degradable ma¬ 
terials was based on common polymers such as 
polyethylene. Compounds were added to make 
these materials decompose in sunlight (i.e., pho¬ 
todegrade), to oxidize by reacting with oxygen in 
the air, and/or to degrade biologically. Unfortu¬ 
nately, this first generation did not measure up to 


expectations. They degraded slowly if at all, and the 
anticipated reduction in landfill waste was not 
realized. These initial disappointments gave 
degradable polymers a bad reputation that hin¬ 
dered their development. By way of response, the 
polymer industry instituted standards that accu¬ 
rately measure degradation rate as well as charac¬ 
terize the mode of degradation. These developments 
led to a renewed interest in biodegradable polymers. 

Development of the current generation of 
biodegradable polymers is frequently directed to 
niche applications that take advantage of their 
short lifetimes. For example, biodegradable leaf 
and yard waste bags can be used to contain com¬ 
postable matter, which eliminates the need to de¬ 
bag the material. 

Another important application of biodegrad¬ 
able plastics is as mulch films for farming (Fig¬ 
ure 22.3). In colder regions of the world, covering 
seedbeds with plastic sheets can extend the grow¬ 
ing season so as to increase crop yields and, in ad¬ 
dition, reduce costs. The plastic sheets absorb heat, 
raise the ground temperature, and increase mois¬ 
ture retention. Traditionally, black polyethylene 
(nonbiodegradable) sheets were used. However, 
at the end of the growing season these sheets had 
to be manually gathered from the field and disposed 
of because they did not decompose/biodegrade. 
More recently, biodegradable plastics have been 
developed for use as mulch films. After the crops 
have been harvested, these films are simply 
plowed into and enrich the soil as they decompose.

films that have been laid out on farmland that is being cultivated.

Other potential opportunities for this group 
of materials exist in the fast-food industry. For ex¬ 
ample, if all of the plates, cups, packaging, and so 
on were based on biodegradable materials, they 
could be commingled with food waste and then 
composted in large-scale urban operations. Not 
only would these measures reduce the amount of 
material entering landfills, but if the polymers 
were derived from renewable materials, a reduc¬ 
tion in greenhouse gas emissions would result. 

In order to reduce our dependence on petro¬ 
leum and the emissions of greenhouse gases, there 
has been a major effort to develop biodegradable 
polymers that are also biorenewable —based on 
plant-derived materials {biomass 2 ). These new 
materials must be cost-competitive with existing 
polymers and capable of being processed using 
conventional techniques (extrusion, injection 
molding, etc.). 

Over the past 30 or so years a number of 
biorenewable polymers have been synthesized 
that have properties comparable to the petroleum- 


derived materials; some are biodegradable, and 
others are not. Perhaps the best known of these 
bioderived polymers is poly(l-lactic acid) (abbre¬ 
viated PLA), which has the following repeat unit 
structure: 



Commercially, PLA is derived from lactic acid; 
however, the raw materials for its manufacture are 
starch-rich renewable products such as corn, sugar 
beets, and wheat. Mechanically, the modulus of 
elasticity and tensile strength of PLA are compa¬ 
rable to poly (ethylene terephthalate), and copoly¬ 
merization with other biodegradable polymers 
[e.g., poly (glycolic acid) (PGA)] promotes prop¬ 
erty alterations so as to allow the use of conven¬ 
tional manufacturing processes such as injection 
molding, extrusion, blow molding, and fiber form¬ 
ing. Other of its properties make PLA desirable 


2 Biomass refers to biological material such as the stems, leaves, and seeds of plants that 
can be used as fuel or as an industrial feed stock. 














22.5 Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering * 883 


as a packaging material, especially for beverages 
and food products—transparency, resistance to at¬ 
tack by moisture and grease, odorlessness, and 
odor barrier characteristics. Furthermore, PLA is 
also bioresorbable, meaning that it is assimilated 
(or absorbed) in biological systems—for example 
the human body. Hence, it has been used in a 
variety of biomedical applications, including re¬ 
sorbable sutures, implants, and controlled release 
of drugs. 

The primary obstacle to the widespread use of 
PLA and other biodegradable polymers has been 
that of high cost, a common problem associated 
with the introduction of new materials. However, 
the development of more efficient and economi¬ 
cal synthesis and processing techniques has re¬ 
sulted in a significant reduction in the cost of this 
class of materials, making them more competitive 
with the conventional petroleum-based polymers. 

Although PLA is biodegradable, it will degrade 
only under carefully controlled circumstances— 
that is, at elevated temperatures generated in com¬ 
mercial composting facilities. At room temperature 
and normal ambient conditions it is stable indefi¬ 
nitely. The degradation products consist of water, 


carbon dioxide, and organic matter. The initial 
stages of the degradation process in which a high- 
molecular-weight polymer is broken into smaller 
pieces is not truly one of “biodegradation” as de¬ 
scribed earlier; rather it involves hydrolytic cleav¬ 
age of the polymer backbone chain, and there is 
little or no evidence of microbial action. How¬ 
ever, the subsequent degradation of these lower- 
molecular-weight fragments is microbial. 

Furthermore, poly(lactic acid) is also 
recyclable—with the right equipment it can be 
converted back into the original monomer and 
then resynthesized to form PLA. 

A number of other characteristics of PLA 
make it an especially attractive material, in par¬ 
ticular for textile applications. For example, it 
may be spun into fibers using conventional melt¬ 
spinning processes (Section 15.24). In addition, 
PLA has excellent crimp and crimp retention, is 
resistant to degradation when exposed to ultravi¬ 
olet light (i.e., resists fading), and is relatively in¬ 
flammable. Other potential applications for this 
material include household furnishings such as 
drapes, upholstery, and awnings, as well as diapers 
and industrial wipes.

Chapter 22 / Economic, Environmental, and Societal Issues in Materials Science 


SUMMARY 


Economic Considerations 

• To minimize product cost, materials engineers must take into account component 
design, the materials used, and manufacturing processes. 

• Other significant economic factors include fringe benefits, labor, insurance, and profit. 

Environmental and Societal Considerations 

• Environmental and societal impacts of production are becoming significant en¬ 
gineering issues. In this regard, the material cradle-to-grave life cycle is an im¬ 
portant consideration. 

• The materials cycle consists of extraction, synthesis/processing, product design/ 
manufacture, application, and disposal stages (Figure 22.1). 

• Efficient operation of the materials cycle is facilitated using an input/output in¬ 
ventory for the life-cycle assessment of a product. Materials and energy are the 
input parameters, whereas outputs include usable products, water effluents, air 
emissions, and solid wastes (Figure 22.2). 

• The earth is a closed system in that its materials resources are finite; to some de¬ 
gree, the same may be said of energy resources. Environmental issues involve 
ecological damage, pollution, and waste disposal. 

• Recycling of used products and the use of green design obviate some of these 
environmental problems. 

Recycling Issues in Materials Science and Engineering 

• Recyclability and disposability issues are important in the context of materials 
science and engineering. Ideally, a material should be at best recyclable, and at 
least biodegradable or disposable. 

• With regard to the recyclability/disposability of the various material types: 

Among metal alloys there are varying degrees of recyclability and biodegrad¬ 
ability (i.e., susceptibility to corrosion). Some metals are toxic and, there¬ 
fore, not disposable. 

Glass is the most common commercial ceramic. It is not biodegradable; fur¬ 
thermore, at present there is no economic incentive to recycle glass. 

Most plastics and rubber are nonbiodegradable. Thermoplastic polymers 
are recyclable, whereas thermosetting materials are for the most part 
nonrecyclable. 

Composite materials are very difficult to recycle because they are composed 
of two or more phases that are normally intermixed on a fine scale.

DESIGN QUESTIONS 


22.D1 Glass, aluminum, and various plastic materi¬ 
als are used for containers (see the chapter¬ 
opening photograph for Chapter 1 and the 
photograph accompanying the Materials of 
Importance box for this chapter). Make a 
list of the advantages and disadvantages 
of using each of these three material 
types; include such factors as cost, recy¬ 
clability, and energy consumption for con¬ 
tainer production. 


22.D2 Discuss why it is important to consider the 
entire life cycle, rather than just the first 
stage. 

22.D3 Discuss how materials engineering can play 
a role in “green design.” 

22.D4 Suggest other consumer actions for minimal 
environmental impact than just recycling. 




Appendix A The International System 


of Units (SI 



Units in the International System of Units fall into two classifications: base and 
derived. Base units are fundamental and not reducible. Table A.l lists the base units 
of interest in the discipline of materials science and engineering. 

Derived units are expressed in terms of the base units, using mathematical signs 
for multiplication and division. For example, the SI units for density are kilogram 
per cubic meter (kg/m 3 ). For some derived units, special names and symbols exist; 
for example, N is used to denote the newton, the unit of force, which is equivalent 
to 1 kg • m/s 2 . Table A.2 contains a number of the important derived units. 

It is sometimes necessary, or convenient, to form names and symbols that are 
decimal multiples or submultiples of SI units. Only one prefix is used when a mul¬ 
tiple of an SI unit is formed, which should be in the numerator. These prefixes and 
their approved symbols are given in Table A.3. Symbols for all units used in this 
book, SI or otherwise, are contained inside the front cover.

This appendix represents a compilation of important properties for approxi¬ 
mately 100 common engineering materials. Each table contains data values of one 
particular property for this chosen set of materials; also included is a tabulation of 
the compositions of the various metal alloys that are considered (Table B.10). Data 
are tabulated by material type (metals and metal alloys; graphite, ceramics, and 
semiconducting materials; polymers; fiber materials; and composites). Within each 
classification, the materials are listed alphabetically. 

A couple of comments are appropriate relative to the content of these tables. 
First, data entries are expressed either as ranges of values or as single values that 
are typically measured. Also, on occasion, “(min)” is associated with an entry; this 
means that the value cited is a minimum one.

Append,^ C Costs and Relative Costs for 

Selected Engineering 
Materials 


This appendix contains price information for the same set of materials for which 
the properties are included in Appendix B. The collection of valid cost data for 
materials is an extremely difficult task, which explains the dearth of materials pricing 
information in the literature. One reason for this is that there are three pricing tiers: 
manufacturer, distributor, and retail. Under most circumstances, we have cited dis¬ 
tributor prices. For some materials (e.g., specialized ceramics such as silicon carbide 
and silicon nitride), it was necessary to use manufacturers’ prices. In addition, there 
may be significant variation in the cost for a specific material. There are several rea¬ 
sons for this. First, each vendor has its own pricing scheme. Furthermore, cost will 
depend on quantity of material purchased and, in addition, how it was processed 
or treated. We have endeavored to collect data for relatively large orders—that is, 
quantities on the order of 900 kg (2000 lb m ) for materials that are ordinarily sold 
in bulk lots —and also for common shapes/treatments. When possible, we obtained 
price quotes from at least three distributors/manufacturers. 

This pricing information was collected in January 2007. Cost data are in U.S. 
dollars per kilogram; in addition, these data are expressed as both price ranges and 
single-price values. The absence of a price range (i.e., when a single value is cited) 
means either that the variation is small or that, on the basis of limited data, it is not 
possible to identify a range of prices. Furthermore, inasmuch as material prices 
change over time, it was decided to use a relative cost index; this index represents 
the per unit mass cost (or average per unit mass cost) of a material divided by the 
average per unit mass cost of a common engineering material—A36 plain carbon 
steel. Although the price of a specific material will vary over time, the price ratio 
between that material and another will, most likely, change more slowly.
